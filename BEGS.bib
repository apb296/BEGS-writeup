abstract = {This paper develops the quantitative implications of optimal fiscal policy in a business cycle model. In a stationary equilibrium, the ex ante tax rate on capital income is approximately zero. There is an equivalence class of ex post capital income tax rates and bond policies that support a given allocation. Within this class, the optimal ex post capital tax rates can range from close to independently and identically distributed to close to a random walk. The tax rate on labor income fluctuates very little and inherits the persistence properties of the exogenous shocks; thus there is no presumption that optimal labor tax rates follow a random walk. Most of the welfare gains realized by switching from a tax system like that of the United States to the Ramsey system come from an initial period of high taxation on capital income.

abstract = {We provide an introduction to optimal fiscal and monetary policy using the primal approach to optimal taxation. We use this approach to address how fiscal and monetary policy should be set over the long run and over the business cycle. We find four substantive lessons for policymaking: Capital income taxes should be high initially and then roughly zero; tax rates on labor and consumption should be roughly constant; state-contingent taxes on assets should be used to provide insurance against adverse shocks; and monetary policy should be conducted so as to keep nominal interest rates close to zero. We begin by studying optimal taxation in a static context. We then develop a general framework to analyze optimal fiscal policy. Finally, we analyze optimal monetary policy in three commonly used models of money: a cash-credit economy, a money-in-the-utility-function economy, and a shopping-time economy.},

We show that competitive equilibria are constrained inefficient. The government can improve welfare by distorting capital accumulation with the sign ofthe distortion depending on the nature of the skill process. Finally, we show that private insurance provision responds endogenously to policy, that government insurance tends to crowd out private insurance, and, in a calibrated example, that this crowding out effect is large.},

@techreport{NBERw18035,
abstract = {This paper studies the cyclical nature of individual income risk using a confidential dataset from the U.S. Social Security Administration, which contains (uncapped) earnings histories for millions of individuals. The base sample is a nationally representative panel containing 10 percent of all U.S. males from 1978 to 2010. We use these data to decompose individual income growth during recessions into “between-group” and “within-group” components. We begin with the behavior of within-group shocks. Contrary to past research, we do not find the variance of idiosyncratic income shocks to be countercyclical. Instead, it is the left-skewness of shocks that is strongly countercyclical. That is, during recessions, the upper end of the shock distribution collapses—large upward income movements become less likely—whereas the bottom end expands—large drops in income become more likely. Thus, while the dispersion of shocks does not increase, shocks become more left skewed and, hence, risky during recessions.
 Second, to study between-group differences, we group individuals based on several observable characteristics at the time a recession hits. One of these characteristics—the average income of an individual at the beginning of a business cycle episode—proves to be an especially good predictor of fortunes during a recession: prime-age workers that enter a recession with high average earnings suffer substantially less compared with those who enter with low average earnings (which is not the case during expansions). Finally, we find that the cyclical nature of income risk is dramatically different for the top 1 percent compared with all other individuals—even relative to those in the top 2 to 5 percent.},

abstract = {Within a rational expectations framework, policy has effect if it alters relative prices and policy evaluations are exercises in modern public finance theory. The time inconsistency of an optimal taxation plan precludes the use of standard control theory for its determination. In this article recursive methods are developed that overcome this difficulty. The technique is novel in that the constraint set as well as the value function are determined recursively. Even though there is little hope of the optimal plan being implemented - because of its time inconsistency - we think the exercise is of more than pedagogical interest. The optimal plan's return is a benchmark with which to compare the time consistent solution under alternative institutional constraints which society might choose to impose upon itself.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the structure and time-consistency of optimal fiscal and monetary policy in an economy without capital. In a dynamic context, optimal taxation means distributing tax distortions over time in a welfare-maximizing way. For a barter economy, our main finding is that with debt commitments of sufficiently rich maturity structure, an optimal policy, if one exists, is time-consistent. In a monetary economy, the idea of optimal taxation must be broadened to include an ‘inflation tax’, and we find that time-consistency does not carry over. An optimal ‘inflation tax’ requires commitment by ‘rules’ in a sense that has no counterpart in the dynamic theory of ordinary excise taxes. The reason time-consistency fails in a monetary economy is that nominal assets should, from a welfare-maximizing point of view, always be taxed away via an immediate inflation in a kind of ‘capital levy’. This emerges as a new possibility when money is introduced into an economy without capital.},

@article{Magill1994,
abstract = {The model of general equilibrium with incomplete markets is a generalization of the Arrow-Debreu model which provides a rich framework for studying problems of macroeconomics. This paper shows how the model, which has so far been restricted to economies with a finite horizon, can be extended to the more natural setting of an open-ended future, thereby providing an extension of the finite horizon representative agent models of modern macroeconomics to economies with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets. There are two natural concepts of equilibrium over an infinite horizon which prevent agents from entering into Ponzi schemes, that is, from indefinitely postponing the repayment of their debts. The first is based on debt constraints which place bounds on debt at each date-event; the second is based on transversality conditions which limit the asymptotic rate of growth of debt. The concept of an equilibrium with debt constraint is a natural concept of equilibrium for macroeconomic analysis;
however the concept of an equilibrium with transversality condition is more amenable to theoretical analysis since it permits the powerful techniques of Arrow-Debreu theory to be carried over to the setting of incomplete markets. In an economy in which agents are impatient (expressed by the Mackey continuity of their preference orderings) and have a degree of impatience at each date-event which is bounded below (a concept defined in the paper), we show that the equilibria of an economy with transversality condition coincide with the equilibria with debt constraints. An equilibrium with transversality condition is shown to exist: it follows that for each economy there is an explicit bound M such that an equilibrium with explicit debt constraint M exists, in which the constraint is never binding--this latter property ensuring that the debt constraint, whose objective is to prevent Ponzi schemes, does not in itself introduce a new imperfection into the model over and above the incompleteness of the markets.

@article{Wer07a,
abstract = {I study the optimal taxation of labor and capital in a dynamic economy subject to government expenditure and technology shocks. Unlike representative-agent Ramsey models, workers are heterogenous and lump-sum taxation is not ruled out. I consider two tax scenarios: (a) linear taxation, with a lump-sum intercept and (b) nonlinear-Mirrleesian taxation. When taxes are linear, I derive a partial-equivalence result with Ramsey settings that provides a reinterpretation of such analyses. I find conditions for perfect tax smoothing of labor-income taxes and zero capital taxation. Implications that contrast with Ramsey are derived for public-debt management, for the nature of the time-inconsistency problem and for the viability of replicating complete markets without state-contingent bonds. Shifts in the distribution of skills provide a novel source for variations in tax rates. For the nonlinear tax scenario, I show that taxation based on income averages is optimal.
