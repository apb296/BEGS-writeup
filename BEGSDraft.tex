We study optimal income taxes and transfers in an economy with heterogeneous agents and aggregate shocks. The net distribution of debt holdings across agents influences optimal allocations, transfers,  and tax rates, but the level of government debt does not. Higher cross-section correlations of debt holdings and labor incomes imply more distortions and lower welfare. In
incomplete markets economies, setting taxes and transfers optimally substantially alters
the character of the government's precautionary incentive to accumulate assets relative
to  representative agent Ramsey models like Aiyagari et al.
(2002). We analyze how the government's long-run asset or debt position emerges from  possibly countervailing incentives that confront the Ramsey planner. Its distributional motives make the Ramsey planner want  to smooth transfers  and also possibly to manipulate the correlation between
the interest rate and the government's net asset position vis a vis high skilled workers.  Related forces also shape  higher frequency optimal government responses to recessions accompanied
by shifts in the cross-section distribution of skills, responses that differ markedly from those emerging from models with a representative consumer.%

\section{Introduction}
%
%This paper studies an economy without capital populated by agents differing in skills and a Ramsey planner who cares about inequality
% in economic outcomes.  For much of the paper, we restrict our Ramsey planner to levy taxes that are affine with a constant
%  and slope that are allowed to depend on the history of aggregate shocks and the distribution of financial assets across people.
%   We find that big  government debts are not distortionary. What matters is how government debt is distributed relative to redistributive motives of the government. After establishing the  irrelevance of agents' gross asset positions in a fairly general setting,
% this paper proceeds to analyze  a sequence of examples designed to show  how net asset positions affect optimal government policies and optimal allocations.

This paper studies  an economy with  agents who differ in
their productivities and a  benevolent government that imposes an affine income tax that consists of a distortionary proportional
tax on labor income and a lump-sum tax or transfer. We
impose no restrictions on the sign of transfers. If some agents are
sufficiently poor or if the government wants enough redistribution, the
government  always chooses positive transfers.
For most of the paper, we  study an economy without capital in
which  a one-period risk-free bond is the only financial asset traded.


We obtain  three sets of findings, one that is purely mechanical but that nevertheless reveals basic principles that underly the other two more novel and interesting collections of results.
The first set of findings describes the irrelevance of government debt, an extension of Ricardian irrelevance reasoning that
identifies the distribution of net assets across agents as a component of a  state vector that restrains the time $t$ decisions
of a Ramsey planner.

The second set of results identifies key forces  that affect the  long-run behavior of the distribution of assets in
an  incomplete markets economy in which private agent's and  government portfolios are confined to risk-free one-period claims.
A driving force here is  that decreasing transfers in response to adverse aggregate shocks affects low-income workers disproportionately. This gives a Ramsey planner who cares about low-skilled workers an incentive
 to smooth  fluctuations in transfers.  That makes  the Ramsey planner  want to impart a negative correlation between   fluctuations
in  labor income and a low-income  agent's net assets.  Properly recognizing the relevance  of net but not gross asset positions stressed in
our first set of findings, this  can be accomplished by having the  government  effectively accumulate risk-free claims on high-skilled workers.
But another, possibly countervailing or possibly reinforcing,  force  comes from the Ramsey planner's incentive to  use fluctuations in the  interest rate to compensate for missing asset markets. If interest rates are high (low) when revenue needs are high, it creates an incentive  for the government to accumulate assets (debt) vis-a-vis high-skilled worker.
Thus, depending on the comovement of the interest rate with other fundamentals, these two forces  may either reinforce each other (for example, in response to  a pure TFP shock where the implied interest rates are countercyclical) or go in  opposite direction (for example,
in the case where recessions are accompanied by a lower interest rate due to correlated discount factor shocks).

A third set of results concerns higher frequency implications, in particular,  the nature of  optimal government policy in booms and recessions.
What we have to say about this comes from a  version of our model calibrated to capture what we take to be
key  stylized facts  that during recessions  (1) interest rates fall, and (2) the left tail of the cross-section distribution of labor income falls by more than right tail.
 When we calibrate  to fit those targets, we find that in recessions, it is  optimal to increase taxes, transfers, and issues of
 government debt. %If the  government starts with sufficiently high  initial debt, no noticable trend in debt repayment.
These effects differ substantially both qualitatively and quantitatively from the counterparts in either a representative agent model or our model were a  recession is modeled to be a pure TFP shock that leaves the distribution of skills unchanged.

Here is how we construct these results.
After section \ref{Sec: environment} describes preferences, technologies, endowments, and
information flows, section
\ref{sec:Ricardian101} sets the stage for our subsequent results. Theorem \ref{theorem: main}
exploits the fact that the set of feasible allocations is invariant with respect to changes in transfers and \emph{gross} asset positions that leave
unaltered  \emph{net} asset positions held by agents and the government.  Theorem \ref{theorem: main} and its corollaries imply (a) that Ricardian equivalence holds in the presence of
distorting  taxes; (b) that ad-hoc borrowing limits do not restrict the government's ability to respond to shocks; and (c) that government debt
is not among the  state variables relevant for formulating  optimal policy problems recursively, while a vector expressing the net distribution of assets among all agents is.
Implication (c) also applies to structures with complete or incomplete asset markets
and more general structures of taxes, with and without physical
capital.  For example, as subsection \ref{Sec: extensions-NDPF} indicates, it applies to structures typical in the New Dynamic Public Finance
(NDPF).


Sections \ref{Sec: characterization}, \ref{Sec: quasilinear}, \ref{sec: longrun anatyt}, and \ref{Sec: numerical}
 incorporate theorem \ref{theorem: main}'s insights about the state variables that are appropriate  for formulating an optimal policy
problem.  Section \ref{Sec: characterization} formulates a pair of Bellman equations, one for $t\geq 1$, another for $t=0$, that
we use to characterize an optimal policy with affine taxes recursively. The policy functions that satisfy the  $t\geq 1$ Bellman equation capture history dependence in the optimal allocation,
the tax rate, and transfers through their dependence on two components of the state vector:  a vector of marginal utility adjusted net asset positions and a vector of pairwise ratios of marginal utilities.

Before analyzing and numerically solving  these Bellman equations, section \ref{Sec: quasilinear}
studies a special case where much can be said analytically, namely,
the  quasi-linear preferences  (they are linear in consumption) featured in a leading example of \citet{Aiyagari2002} (henceforth AMSS).  \textcolor{blue}{We characterize some important differences that emerge in our heterogeneous agent economy with affine taxes vis a vis the representative agent economy with
linear taxes of AMSS. The key finding is that concerns for redistributions can impart a welfare cost of fluctuating transfers if asset distribution is sufficiently skewed. Most clear in a two agent setting, we show that disarming non-negativity constraints on the consumption of an agent whose Pareto weight is low, the optimal tax-transfer-debt policy distributes assets toward that agent until a point is eventually reached after which all fluctuations in government expenditures can be absorbed by adjusting transfers. The tax rate and output are constant thereafter. Thus,unlike the AMSS outcome,
the tail allocation is not first-best and the tail of the distorting tax rate on labor income is constant but not zero. Further there exists bounds on the long run distribution of net assets that are inversely related to how redistributory the government is. These outcomes reflect how very different `precautionary savings' motives operate in our economy versus the AMSS economy.}

% We characterize some important
%  differences that emerge in our heterogeneous agent economy with affine taxes vis a vis the representative agent economy with
%  linear taxes of AMSS.   First, in our heterogeneous agent economy,  there exists a unique set  that contains the ergodic distribution of net  assets, one that is approached starting from  all initial
%  distributions of net asset positions.  Second, to ameliorate   non-negativity constraints on the consumption of an  agent whose Pareto weight is low, the optimal tax-transfer-debt policy  distributes assets  toward that agent  until a point is eventually  reached after which  all fluctuations in government expenditures can be absorbed by adjusting transfers. The tax rate and  output are constant thereafter.  Third,   unlike the AMSS outcome,
%  the tail allocation is not first-best and the tail of the distorting tax rate on labor income is constant but not zero.
%  These outcomes reflect how very different `precautionary savings' motives operate in our economy versus the AMSS economy.


\textcolor{blue}{The section \ref{Sec: quasilinear} quasi-linear preference specification is useful for isolating key forces influencing
limiting outcomes, but it acquires its analytical tractability by eliminating endogenous interest rate fluctuations.
Interest rate fluctuations can be correlated with fundamentals (i.e., government expenditures and shocks to the distribution
of skills). Section \ref{sec: longrun anatyt} studies how preference specifications
featuring aversion to consumption risk simulataneously activates two forces : Like before,owing to \emph{affine taxes}transfers produce fluctuations in inequality,(this effect resembles binding non-negativity constraints in quasi-linear case) and secondly we have endogenous fluctuations in interest rates that induces risk in the government's earnings on its holdings of risk-free bonds, via their correlations with fundamentals., Both these avenues influence the long run distribution of net assets. Under the optimal policy,typically, there exists an ergodic set in the space of marginal utility adjusted net asset positions and pairwise ratios of marginal utilities to which balances this forces. Within that ergodic set, fluctuations of the state vector are typically quite small relative to its variation along transient paths approaching that set. The effects are most clear in a two agent economy with exogenous binary IID aggregate shocks where we can show that the ergodic set is a single point. In that special case, history dependence
of allocations, the tax rate, and transfers vanish after that point is attained. The endogenous correlation of interest rates with fundamentals governing government
expenditures, transfers or fluctuations in the labor tax base (coming from endogenous responses to different types of shocks to skill distributions) is a key determinant of the ergodic set for the distribution of net asset positions.}

 For a calibrated version of our economy, section \ref{Sec: numerical} studies both asymptotic and transient responses to shocks
 that    in different ways shape the endogenous correlation between interest rates and the government's revenue needs.  We allow correlated shocks
 to the skill distribution, to discount factors, and to government expenditures.
We find  low frequency components that ultimately determine  ergodic sets for the two state vectors, and through them, the dynamics of tail allocations and tail government policies.  The origin of the shock is also crucial for determining the policy mix over higher frequencies. For example, if recessions are accompanied with increases in inequality, in a recession the optimal policy increases  transfers, the tax rate, and   government debt, under a plausible
normalization.

\subsection{Relationships to literatures}

Two literatures study optimal fiscal policy in
response to  aggregate shocks. A large  literature on Ramsey problems  exogenously rules out transfers in
the context of
representative agent models.
 \citet{Barro1979}, \citet{LucasJr.1983}, \citet{Chari1994},  and AMSS are leading  examples of this approach.
In contrast to those papers, our Ramsey planner cares about redistribution among
agents with different skills and wealths. Other than prohibiting them from depending explicitly
on agent's personal identity, we leave   transfers unrestricted and have the Ramsey planner set
them optimally. Nevertheless, we find that  some of the general principles that emerge from that
representative agent, no-transfers literature continue to hold, in particular, the prescription to
smooth distortions across time and states.  However, it is also true that
allowing the government to set transfers optimally substantially changes
qualitative and quantitative insights about the optimal policy in important respects.

A second strand of literature focuses on the optimal policy in settings with
heterogeneous agents when a government can impose arbitrary taxes subject only
to explicit informational constraints (see \citet{golosov2007new} for a review). A striking result from that literature
is that when  agent's asset holdings are perfectly observable, the distribution of assets among
agents is irrelevant and an optimal allocation can be achieved purely through
taxation (see, e.g. \citet{Bassetto2004}).   We are able to show that when
agents' assets are not observable, the mechanism design problem has some of
the same general features as the more simplified Ramsey problem that we
study (for example, history dependence of optimal allocations).  But because  characterization of dynamic mechanism design models with
unobservable asset trading is an intricate topic in itself, we leave further analysis along this
direction to the  future.

Several recent papers impute distributive concerns to a Ramsey planner.
Three papers that are perhaps most closely related to ours are \citet{Bassetto2004}, \citet{shin2006ramsey}, and \citet{Wer07a}. Like us, those authors depart from
a representative agent assumption by allowing heterogeneity and considering
distributional consequences of alternative tax and borrowing policies.
The first paper by Bassetto and Kocherlakota  extends the \citet{LucasJr.1983} environment to include $I$ types of
agents who are heterogeneous in their time-invariant labor productivities $%
w_{i}$. There are complete markets and a Ramsey planner who has access only
to proportional taxes on labor income and history-contingent borrowing and
lending. The authors study how the Ramsey planner's vector of Pareto weights
influences how he responds to government expenditures and other shocks by
adjusting the proportional labor tax and government borrowing to cover
expenses while manipulating prices in ways that redistribute wealth between
low-$w_{i}$ type `rentiers' whose main income is from their asset holdings
and high-$w_{i}$ type `workers' whose main income source is their labor.

\citet{shin2006ramsey} extends the AMSS economy to have two risk-averse households who
face idiosyncratic income risk. When idiosyncratic income risk is big enough
relative to aggregate government expenditure risk, the Ramsey planner
chooses to issue debt in order to help households engage in precautionary
saving, thereby overturning the AMSS result that  in their quasi-linear case a
 Ramsey planner  eventually sets taxes to zero and lives off its earnings from assets forevermore.
  Shin emphasizes that the
government does this at the cost of imposing tax distortions. While being
confined to proportional labor income taxes and nonnegative
transfers, Shin's Ramsey planner balances two competing self-insurance
motives: aggregate tax smoothing and individual consumption smoothing.

\citet{Wer07a} studies a complete markets economy with heterogeneous agents
and transfers that are unrestricted in sign. He obtains counterparts to our
results about net versus gross asset positions, including that government
assets can be set to zero in all periods. Because he allows unrestricted
taxation of initial assets, the initial distribution of assets plays no
role. Theorem \ref{theorem: main} and its corollaries substantially
generalize Werning's results by showing that all allocations of assets among
agents and the government that imply the same optimal net asset position
lead to the same optimal allocation, a conclusion that holds for market
structures beyond complete markets. \citet{Wer07a} provides an extensive
characterization of optimal allocations and distortions in complete market
economies, while we focus on precautionary savings motives for private
agents and the government that are not present when markets are complete.$%
^{,}$\footnote{%
\cite{Werning2012} studies optimal taxation with incomplete markets and explores
conditions under which optimal taxes depend only on the aggregate state.}
\footnote{%
More recent closely related papers are \citet{Azzimonti2008,Azzimonti2008a} and \citet{Correia2010}. While these authors study optimal policy in
 economies in which agents are heterogeneous in skills and initial assets, they
  do not allow aggregate shocks.}


\section{Environment\label{Sec: environment}}

\smallskip  %In each period $t\geq 0$, e
Exogenous fundamentals
of the
economy are  functions of a shock  $s_{t}$  that follows an irreducible Markov process, where $s_{t}\in S$ and $S$ is a finite set. We let $s^{t}=\left(
s_{0},...,s_{t}\right) $ denote a history of shocks.

%There are $I$ types of infinitely lived agents.
There is a mass $\pi _{i}$
of a type $i\in I$ agent, with $\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi _{i}=1.$ Types differ by their skills.
Preferences of an
agent of type $i$ over stochastic processes for consumption $\{c_{i,t}\}_t$
and labor supply $\{l_{i,t}\}_t$ are ordered by
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty } \bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^t \beta(s_j)\bigr] U^{i}\left(
c_{i,t},l_{i,t}\right)  \label{utility lifetime}
\end{equation}%
where $\mathbb{E}_{t}$ is a mathematical expectations operator conditioned
on time $t$ information and $\beta(s_t) \in \left( 0,1\right) $ is a state-dependent discount
factor\footnote{We allow the discount factor to depend on the Markov state $s$ to generate flexible  comovement patterns between real interest rates and fundamentals. }. We assume that $l_{i}\in \left[ 0,\bar{l}_{i}\right] $ for some $%
\bar{l}_{i}<\infty .$ Results in section  \ref{sec:Ricardian101} require no
additional assumptions on $U^{i}$ like  differentiability or convexity, but results in later sections do.\footnote{Consequently  our setup allows both extensive and intensive responses of labor.}

An agent of type $i$ who supplies $l_{i}$ units of labor produces $\theta
_{i}\left( s_t\right) l_{i}$ units of output, where $\theta _{i}(s_t)\in \Theta $
is a nonnegative state-dependent scalar. Feasible allocations satisfy
\begin{equation}%\label{eqn:feasiblity}
\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi_{i}c_{i,t}+g\left( s_{t}\right) =\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi
_{i}\theta _{i}\left( s_{t}\right) l_{i,t},  \label{feasibility goods}
\end{equation}%
where $g\left( s_{t}\right) $ denotes exogenous government expenditures in
state $s_{t}.$
 We allow $s_t$ to
affect $\beta(s_t)$, government expenditures $g(s_t)$, and the type-specific productivities $\theta_i(s_t)$.

To save on notation, mostly we
use $z_{t}$ to denote a random variable with a time $t$ conditional
distribution that is a function of the history $s^{t}$.
 Occasionally, we use the more explicit notion $z\left(
s^{t}\right) $ to denote a realization  at
a particular history $s^{t}.$

%\textcolor{blue}{From Anmol :  Do we want $ \bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^t \beta(s_j)\bigr] $ or  $\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^t \beta_j\bigr]$ . If yes, this needs to be modified in a couple of places}

A Ramsey  planner's preferences over a vector of stochastic processes for consumption and
work are ordered by
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}%
where the Pareto weights satisfy $\alpha _{i}\geq 0,$ $\sum_{i=1}^{I}\alpha _{i}=1$.

In most of this paper, we study an optimal  government policy when agents can   trade
only a one-period risk-free bond.  Except in section \ref{Sec: extensions-NDPF}, we assume that the government  imposes an
affine tax
\begin{equation*}
T_t + \tau_t \theta_{i,t}l_{i,t}. \end{equation*}
%We allow the government to choose a feasible sequence of transfers $%
%\{T_{t}\} $.
We do not restrict the sign of $T_{t}$ at any $t$ or $s^t$. %This means that our analysis covers the following example: if
If for some type $i$, $\alpha_i >0, \theta _{i,t}=0$, and $b_{i, -1} = 0$, then  the planner will choose a nonnegative  present value of
transfers, since that is the sole source of a type $i$ agent's wealth and consumption.

While results in sections \ref{Sec: characterization}, \ref{Sec: quasilinear}, \ref{sec: longrun anatyt}, and  \ref{Sec: numerical}  depend on these  assumptions about an affine tax system and incomplete markets,
  key results of  section  \ref{sec:Ricardian101} apply under  more general tax functions and
market structures.

Under an affine tax system, agent $i$'s budget constraint at $t$ is%
\begin{equation}
c_{i,t}+b_{i,t}=\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta
_{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}b_{i,t-1}+T_{t},  \label{agent bc affine}
\end{equation}%
where $b_{i,t}$ denotes asset holdings of a type $i$ agent  at time $t\geq 0$, $%
R_{t-1}$ is a gross risk-free one-period interest rate from  $t-1$ to
 $t$ for $t\geq 1$, and $R_{-1}\equiv 1$. For $t\geq 0$, $R_{t}$ is
measurable with respect to $s^t$. To rule out Ponzi schemes,
we assume that $b_{i,t}$ must be bounded from below. Except in subsection \ref{Sec: extensions}, we
impose no further constraints on agents'  borrowing  and lending. Subsection \ref{Sec: extensions} briefly studies economies with
arbitrary borrowing constraints.

The government budget constraint is%
\begin{equation}
g_{t}+B_{t}=\tau _{t}\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi _{i}\theta
_{i,t}l_{i,t}-T_{t}+R_{t-1}B_{t-1},  \label{govmt bc affine}
\end{equation}%
where $B_{t}$ denotes the government's assets at time $t$, which we assume
are bounded from below. Our assumptions about preferences
imply that the government can collect only finite revenues in each period, so
this restriction rules out government-run Ponzi schemes.

We assume that private agents and the government start with  assets $%
\{b_{i,-1}\}_{i=1}^{I}$ and $B_{-1}$, respectively.  Asset holdings
satisfy the market clearing condition%
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi _{i}b_{i,t}+B_{t}=0\text{ for all }t\geq -1.
\label{feasibility bonds}
\end{equation}%
Since $B_{t}$ and all $b_{i,t}$ are bounded from below,  (\ref%
{feasibility bonds}) implies that they are also bounded from above.

\section{\protect\smallskip Relevant and Irrelevant Aspects of  the Distribution of Government Debt\label{sec:Ricardian101}}
%
%\textcolor{blue}{Remark from Anmol: Proposition 1 is implied by theorem 1. We can reduce some overlap by starting with the theorem 1 and mentioning Proposition 1 as corollary. I have attempted to reorder the discussion in the section to reflect this}
%\textcolor{red}{Remark from Tom: Anmol, I agree with you very much. Also, much of this section has nothing to do with an {\em optimal}
%equilibrium. I have done some editing to reflect this. I have written an incendiary anti Reinhart-Rogoff first paragraph to this section. }
This section sets forth  a  result that underlies much of the analysis in this paper, namely, that  the level
of government debt is not a state variable for our economy.  The reason is that there is an equivalence class of tax policies and asset profiles that support the same competitive equilibrium allocation.
A competitive  equilibrium allocation pins down only net asset  positions.
The assertions in this section apply to all competitive equilibria, not just the optimal ones that will be our focus in subsequent sections.

%\textcolor{blue}{Do we need a * on the initial conditions in the statement of te theorem. Previously we have used * to denote the optimal competitive equilibrium. I feel that this proof can be re-written without the *}

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem: main} Given $\left( \left \{ b_{i,-1}\right \}
_{i},B_{-1}\right) $, let $\left \{ \left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i},B_{t},R_{t}\right \} _{t} $ and $\left \{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right
\} _{t}$ be a competitive equilibrium. For any bounded sequences $%
\left \{ \hat{b}_{i,t}\right \} _{i,t\geq -1}$ that satisfy
\begin{equation*}
\hat{b}_{i,t}-\hat{b}_{1,t}=\tilde{b}_{i,t}\equiv b_{i,t}	-b_{1,t}\text{ for all }t\geq -1,i\geq 2,
\end{equation*}%
there exist  sequences $\left \{ \hat{T}_{t}\right \} _{t}$ and $%
\left \{ \hat{B}_{t}\right \} _{t\geq -1}$ that satisfy (\ref{feasibility
bonds}) such that $\left \{ \left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}%
_{i,t}\right \} _{i},\hat{B}_{t},R_{t}\right \} _{t}$ and $\left \{
\tau _{t},\hat{T}_{t}\right \} _{t}$ constitute a competitive
equilibrium given $\left( \left \{ \hat{b}_{i,-1}\right \} _{i},\hat{B}%
_{-1}\right) $.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let
\begin{equation}
\hat{T}_{t}=T_{t} + \left(\hat{b}_{1,t} - b_{1,t}\right) -
R_{t-1}\left(\hat{b}_{1,t-1} - b_{1,t-1}\right) \text{ for
all }t\geq 0.  \label{construct That}
\end{equation}%
Given  a tax policy $\left \{ \tau _{t},\hat{T}_{t}\right \} _{t},$ the
allocation $\left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}_{i,t}\right \}
_{t}$ is a feasible choice for consumer $i$ since it satisfies%
\begin{eqnarray*}
c_{i,t}&=&\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta _{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}b_{i,t-1}-b_{i,t}+T_{t}.\\
&=&\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta _{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}\left( b_{i,t-1}-b_{1,t-1}\right) -\left(
b_{i,t}-b_{1,t}\right) +T_{t}+R_{t-1}b_{1,t-1}-b_{1,t} \\
&=&\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta _{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}\left( \hat{b}_{i,t-1}-\hat{b}_{1,t-1}\right) -\left( \hat{b%
}_{i,t}-\hat{b}_{1,t}\right) +T_{t}+R_{t-1}b_{1,t-1}-b_{1,t} \\
 &=&\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta
_{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}\hat{b}_{i,t-1}-\hat{b}_{i,t}+\hat{T}_{t}
\end{eqnarray*}%
Suppose that $\left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}_{i,t}\right \}
_{t}$ is not the optimal choice for consumer $i$, in the sense that there exists some
other sequence $\left \{ \hat{c}_{i,t},\hat{l}_{i,t},\hat{b}_{i,t}\right \}
_{t}$ that gives strictly higher utility.  Then the choice $%
\left \{ \hat{c}_{i,t},\hat{l}_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{t}$ is
feasible given the tax rates  $\left \{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right \} _{t}$%
, which contradicts the assumption that $\left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{t}$ is the optimal choice for
the consumer given taxes $\left \{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right \}
_{t}$. The new allocation satisfies all other constraints and
therefore is an equilibrium.
\end{proof}

\smallskip An immediate corollary is  that it is not
total government debt but rather who owns it that affects equilibrium
allocations.

\begin{corollary}
\label{corr: B does not matter} For any pair $B_{-1}^{\prime },B_{-1}^{\prime
\prime }$, there are asset profiles $\left\{ b_{i,-1}^{\prime }\right\} _{i}$ and $%
\left\{ b_{i,-1}^{\prime \prime }\right\} _{i}$ such that
equilibrium allocations starting from  $\left( \left\{ b_{i,-1}^{\prime }\right\}
_{i},B_{-1}^{\prime }\right) $ and  from  $\left( \left\{ b_{i,-1}^{\prime
\prime }\right\} _{i},B_{-1}^{\prime \prime }\right) $ are the same.
%Such sequences $\left\{ b_{i,-1}^{\prime }\right\} _{i}$ and $\left\{
%b_{i,-1}^{\prime \prime }\right\} _{i}$
These asset profiles satisfy%
\begin{equation*}
b_{i,-1}^{\prime }-b_{1,-1}^{\prime }=b_{i,-1}^{\prime \prime
}-b_{1,-1}^{\prime \prime }\text{ for all }i.
\end{equation*}
\end{corollary}
%
%\textcolor{red}{Anmol -- I deleted `optimal' as a modifier of `equilibrium' in the above corollary.}
%\textcolor{blue}{Anmol : I replaced the word ``sequences'' with ``asset profiles''. }


%
%\smallskip These observations  highlight the importance of relative asset
%holdings. Define agents' \textit{net assets positions} $%
%\left\{ \tilde{b}_{i,t}\right\} _{t,i\geq 2}$ as
%\begin{equation*}
%\tilde{b}_{i,t}=b_{i,t}-b_{1,t}\text{ for all }t\geq -1,i\geq 2.
%\end{equation*}

\smallskip
This result is closely related to Ricardian Equivalence in \citet{Barro1974}. There are however some important distinctions. In Barro's representative agent model lump sum taxes are not distortionary. In our economy, since the planner does not have person-specific taxes, a lump sum transfer introduces distortions in inequality and as we will see in following sections this force has a significant effect on optimal policy. Despite this, Ricardian equivalence contrinues to hold
.\footnote{%
\citet{Wallace1981}'s Modigliani-Miller theorem for a class of government open
market operations has a similar flavor.  \citet{sargent1987dynamic} describes the
structure of a set of related Modigliani-Miller theorems for government
finance.} %\textcolor{red}{Anmol: I deleted the phrase ` in the optimum'. And I deleted `optimal'
%from a couple places in the following section.  The argument doesn't depend on the equilibria being optimal.}
Theorem \ref{theorem: main} shows that many different transfer
sequences $\left\{ T_{t}\right\} _{t}$ and asset profiles $\left\{
b_{i,t},B_{t}\right\} _{i,t}$  support the same  equilibrium allocation.
For example, one can set government assets $B_{i,t}=0$ without loss of
generality.
%Theorem \ref{theorem: main} shows that the underlying economic mechanisms will
%generally be quite different from those in  representative agent economies
%in which restrictions on a government's ability to borrow and lend significantly affect
%optimal equilibrium outcomes, e.g. AMSS or Faraglia et al.\ (2012).
Alternatively,  we can normalize  assets $b_{i,t}$ of any type $i$.

Theorem \ref{theorem: main} continues to hold in more general environments. For example, we could allow
agents to trade all  Arrow securities and still show that  equilibrium
allocations depend only on agents' net assets positions.
Similarly, our results   hold in  economies with capital.
In section \ref{Sec: extensions-NDPF},  we explore outcomes when a government has
access to more general taxes, for example, of a form $T_{t}(y_{t})$ or $%
T_{t}(y_{t},...,y_{0})$. While those richer  tax systems  allow better redistribution and
smaller distortions, they do not affect  the conclusions of theorem \ref{theorem: main}.

\subsection{Extension 1: Borrowing constraints\label{Sec: extensions}}
%\textcolor{blue}{Anmol : I have removed proposition 2 and addeda mention that the corollary to theorem 1 is valid under adhoc borrowing constraints too. We dont have anything more to say about it. }
%
%\textcolor{blue}{Anmol : I have attempted to re-write the appendix in a way that it is self-contained. The earlier one had forward references and missing arguments.}

Representative agent models  rule out  Ricardian equivalence
either  by assuming distorting taxes or by imposing ad hoc borrowing constraints. %In section \ref{sec:Ricardian101},
By way of contrast, we have verified that Ricardian equivalence holds in our economy even though
there are distorting taxes. % are typically part of an optimal equilibrium.
Imposing ad-hoc borrowing limits also leaves Ricardian equivalence intact in our economy.\footnote{%
\citet{Bryant1984} describe how a government can use borrowing
constraints as part of a welfare-improving policy to finance exogenous
government expenditures.\citet{Sargent1987} describe Modigliani-Miller
theorems for government finance in a collection of economies in which
borrowing constraints on classes of agents produce the kind of rate of
return discrepancies that Bryant and Wallace manipulate.} In economies with
exogenous borrowing constraints, agents' maximization problems  include the
additional constraints
\begin{equation}
b_{i,t}\geq \underline{b}_{i}  \label{borrowing constraint}
\end{equation}%
for some exogenously given $\left\{ \underline{b}_{i}\right\} _{i}.$ %We
%define an equilibrium similarly to Definition \ref{Def: CE with affine taxes}%
\begin{definition}
\label{Def: CE with affine taxes borrowing constraints}For given $\left(
\left \{ b_{i,-1},\underline{b}_{i}\right \} _{i},B_{-1}\right) $ and $%
\left
\{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right \} _{t},$ a competitive equilibrium with
affine taxes and exogenous borrowing constraints is a sequence $\{ \left \{
c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i},B_{t},R_{t}\}_{t} $ such that $%
\left
\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i,t}$ maximizes (\ref{utility
lifetime})\ subject to (\ref{agent bc affine}) and (\ref{borrowing
constraint}), $\{ \left \{ b_{i,t}\right \}_{i},B_{t}\}_{t}$ are bounded,
and constraints (\ref{feasibility goods}), (\ref{govmt bc affine})\ and (\ref%
{feasibility bonds})\ are satisfied.
\end{definition}

We can define an \emph{optimal} competitive equilibrium with exogenous borrowing
constraints by extending Definition \ref{Def: optimal CE affine}.

%The role of the initial distribution of assets  is
%unaffected by the introduction of the ad-hoc debt limits and  so is Corollary  \ref{corr: B does not matter}.
The introduction of the ad-hoc debt limits leaves unaltered the conclusions of  Corollary  \ref{corr: B does not matter} and
the role of the initial distribution of assets across agents.
 The next proposition asserts
that ad-hoc borrowing limits do not limit a government's ability to respond to
aggregate shocks.\footnote{%
See \citet{Yared2012,Yared2013}  shows a closely related result.}
\smallskip

\begin{proposition}
\label{thm:borrowing_constraint}  Given an initial asset distribution $\left(
\left\{ b_{i,-1}\right\} _{i},B_{-1}\right)$, let $\left\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ and $\left\{ R_{t}\right\}_t $ be a competitive
equilibrium allocation and interest rate sequence in an economy without
exogenous borrowing constraints. Then for any exogenous
constraints $\left\{ \underline{b}_{i}\right\} _{i}$, there is a government
tax policy $\left\{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right\} _{t}$ such that $\left\{
c_{i,t},l_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ is a competitive equilibrium
allocation in an economy with exogenous borrowing constraints $\left(
\left\{ b_{i,-1},\underline{b}_{i}\right\} _{i},B_{-1}\right) $ and $\left\{
\tau _{t},T_{t}\right\} _{t}.$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $\left\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$
be a competitive equilibrium allocation without exogenous borrowing
constraints. Let $\Delta _{t}\equiv \max_{i}\left\{ \underline{b}%
_{i}-b_{i,t}\right\} .$ Define $\hat{b}_{i,t}\equiv b_{i,t}+\Delta _{t}$ \ for all $t\geq 0$ and $\hat{b}_{i,-1}=b_{-1}.$ By Theorem %
\ref{theorem: main}, $\left\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}%
_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ is also a competitive equilibrium allocation without
exogenous borrowing constraints. Moreover, by construction $\hat{b}_{i,t}-%
\underline{b}_{i}=b_{i,t}+\Delta _{t}-\underline{b}_{i}\geq 0$.
Therefore, $\hat{b}_{i,t}$ satisfies (\ref{borrowing constraint}). Since
agents' budget sets are smaller in the economy with exogenous borrowing
constraints, and $\left\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}%
_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ are feasible at interest rate process $\left\{
R_{t}\right\} _{t}$, then $\left\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},%
\hat{b}_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ is also an optimal choice for agents in the
economy with exogenous borrowing constraints $\left\{ \underline{b}%
_{i}\right\} _{i}.$ Since all market clearing conditions are satisfied, $%
\left\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ is a
competitive equilibrium allocation and asset profile.
\end{proof}

To explore the intuition underlying Proposition \ref{thm:borrowing_constraint}, suppose to the contrary that the exogenous borrowing constraints  restricted a  government's
 ability to achieve a desired allocation. That  means that
the government would want to increase  its borrowing
and to repay agents later, which the borrowing constraints prevent. But the government can just reduce
transfers today and increase them tomorrow. That would  achieve the  desired  allocation
without violating the exogenous borrowing constraints.

Actually, welfare can  be strictly higher in an economy  with exogenous
borrowing constraints  because  a government might want to
push some agents against their borrowing limits. When some agents' borrowing
constraints bind, their shadow interest rates differ from the
common interest rate that unconstrained agents face. When the government rearranges tax
policies to  affect the  interest rate, it affects constrained and unconstrained agents
 differently.  By facilitating
redistribution, this can improve welfare. %In the next several paragraphs, we will formalize this
%intuition.
In appendix \ref{appndx: borrowing constraints example}, we construct an example without any
shocks in which the government can achieve higher welfare by using borrowing
constraints to improve its ability to redistribute.
\subsection{Extension 2: More general taxes \label{Sec: extensions-NDPF}}
%\textcolor{red}{From Tom:I have edited this section }

The conclusions  of theorem \ref{theorem: main} also apply in settings typical in  a New Dynamic Public Finance (NDPF)  literature that studies taxes and other arrangements that  decentralize an optimal allocation that respects information gaps between agents and a government.\footnote{%
For surveys, see \citet{golosov2007new} and \cite{kocherlakota2010new}.}
Thus, consider an economy where agents' skills $\theta$ are private information (and do not change over time).  Suppose
that the government observes output $y\equiv \theta l$ and $c$ for each
agent. Constrained optimal allocations solve the mechanism design problem
%\textcolor{red}{From Tom: I have allowed stochastic discount favors.}
\begin{equation}
\max_{\left \{ c_{i,t},y_{i,t}\right \} }\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{i=1}^{I}\alpha
_{i}\pi _{i}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty } \bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^t \beta(s_j)\bigr] U^{i}\left( c_{i,t},\frac{y_{i,t}}{%
\theta _{i}}\right)  \label{mechdes max}
\end{equation}%
subject to incentive constraints%
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^t \beta(s_j)\bigr]U^{i}\left( c_{i,t},\frac{y_{i,t}%
}{\theta _{i}}\right) \geq \mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^t \beta(s_j)\bigr]\left( c_{j,t},\frac{y_{j,t}}{\theta _{i}}\right) \text{ for all }%
i,j  \label{mechdes IC}
\end{equation}%
and the feasibility constraint%
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi _{i}c_{i,t}+g_{t}=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi _{i}y_{i,t}.
\label{mechdes feas}
\end{equation}%
Let $\left \{ c_{i,t}^{sp},y_{i,t}^{sp}\right \} _{i,t}$ be the optimal allocation. To implement the optimal allocation
in a competitive equilibrium, we allow a general
non-linear tax schedule $T_{t}\left( y_{t},X_{t}\right) $, where $X_{t}$ is a vector
of  agent-specific variables like past labor earnings.\footnote{It is easy to see that the optimal allocation is \emph{history independent}. We can rewrite the mechanism design problem as
% (\ref{mechdes max}) as%
\begin{equation*}
\max_{\left \{ c_{i,t},y_{i,t}\right \} }\min_{\left \{ \eta _{ij}\right \} }%
\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{i=1}^{I}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty } \bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^t \beta(s_j)\bigr]\left\{\left( \alpha _{i}\pi _{i}+\eta
_{i,i}\right) U^{i}\left( c_{i,t},\frac{y_{i,t}}{\theta _{i}}\right)
-\sum_{j\neq i}\eta _{j,i}U^{j}\left( c_{j,t},\frac{y_{j,t}}{\theta _{i}}%
\right)\right\} 
\end{equation*}%
subject to (\ref{mechdes feas}). This problem is equivalent to a sequence of
static problems for each realization of $g_{t}.$
Appendix \ref{apndx: unobs-assets} constructs an example that shows if, in addition, agents' assets are also unobservable, then optimal allocations are history dependent}

We assume that agents begin with initial debt
holdings $\left \{ b_{i,-1}\right \} _{i}$ and that each period they can
 trade a one-period risk-free bond with gross return $\{R\}_t$. An
agent's budget constraint is the same as (\ref{agent bc affine}),  except that now
$-T_{t}+\tau y_{t}$ is replaced by $T_{t}\left( y_{t},X_{t}\right) .$ We
modify the definition of a competitive equilibrium with these more general
taxes in the natural way.

Debt plays no significant role, because  if his debt differs from zero, the government
can tax away \textit{all} of an agent's income
from assets by setting $T_{t}\left( y_{t},b_{t-1},F\left( \left \{
y_{s}\right \} _{s=0}^{t-1}\right) \right) =y_{t}+\max \left \{
R_{t}b_{t},0\right \} $ if $b_{t}\neq 0.$

Thus,  in this economy,  a much stronger version of theorem \ref{theorem: main} emerges.%
\footnote{%
See also a related result of \citet{Bassetto2004}, who showed
that when taxes can depend on past labor income, the path of government debt
is indeterminate.}

\begin{corollary}
Any sequence of assets $\left \{ b_{i,t}\right \} _{i,t}$ is a part of an
optimal competitive equilibrium allocation for some optimal non-linear tax $%
T_{t}\left( y_{t},b_{t-1},F\left( \left \{ y_{s}\right \}
_{s=0}^{t-1}\right) \right) .$
\end{corollary}
This conclusion is sensitive to the presumption that the private information pertains only  to agent's skills. Appendix \ref{apndx: unobs-assets} shows that if in addition, agents assets are also unobservable, then theorem \ref{theorem: main} can still be recovered in the sense that only \emph{net} positions matter.

\subsection{Ricardian irrelevance and optimal equilibria}

Our statements about Ricardian irrelevance apply to all competitive equilibrium allocations,
not just the optimal ones that are the main focus of this paper.
To appreciate how  these  Ricardian irrelevance results affect optimal equilibria, suppose that we increase an
initial level of government debt from $0$ to some arbitrary level $%
B_{-1}^{\prime } > 0$. If the government were to hold transfers $\left\{ T_{t}\right\} _{t}$ fixed, it would
 have  to increase  tax rates $\left\{ \tau
_{t}\right\} _{t}$ enough to collect a present value of revenues sufficient to
repay $B_{-1}^{\prime }$. Since deadweight losses are convex in $\tau ,$
higher levels of debt financed with bigger distorting taxes $\{\tau_t\}$  impose larger
distortions on the economy, thereby degrading the equilibrium allocation.  But this would not happen  if
the government were instead  to adjust transfers in response to a higher initial debt. To determine optimal transfers, we need to
know who owns  the initial government debt $B_{-1}^{\prime }$. For example, suppose that agents hold equal amounts of it. Then
each unit of debt repayment achieves the same redistribution as one
unit of transfers. If the original tax policy  at $B_{-1}^{\prime } =0 $ were optimal, then  the best policy for a government with  initial debt $%
B_{-1}^{\prime } >0 $ would be to reduce the present value  transfers by exactly the amount of the
increase in per capita debt, because then distorting taxes $\left\{ \tau
_{t}\right\} $ and the allocation would both remain unchanged.\footnote{This example illustrates
principles proclaimed by Simon \citet[p. 85]{newcomb1865critical} in the quotation with
which we began this paper.}

But the situation would be different if  holdings of government
debt were not equal across agents. For example, suppose  that  richer people owned disproportionately more government debt
than poorer people. That would mean that inequality
is  effectively initially  higher in an economy with higher initial government debt. As a result, a
government with Pareto weights $\{\alpha_i\}$ that favor equality would want to increase both  distorting  tax rates $\left\{ \tau _{t}\right\} $
and transfers $\left\{ T_{t}\right\} $ to offset the increase in inequality
associated with the increase in government debt. The conclusion would be the
opposite if government debt were to be  owned mostly by poorer
households.



This logic shows how important it is to know the distribution of government debt across people. Government debt that is widely distributed across households
(e.g., implicit Social Security debt) is less distorting than
 government debt owned mostly by people whose incomes are at the top of the income
distribution (e.g., government debt held by hedge funds).\footnote{%
It is straightforward to extend our analysis to open economy with foreign
holdings of domestic debt. The more government debt is owned by the
foreigners, the higher are the distorting taxes that  the government  needs to
impose.}



\section{Optimal equilibria with affine taxes\label{Sec: characterization}}
%\textcolor{blue} {Remark from Anmol : I moved this section forward. This helps making the flow of the paper better. Once we setup the characterization  , the next two section deal with special cases where we prove theorems and the last section describes the numerical results}
%\textcolor{red}{Anmol -- I approve very much. I have done some editing.}

This section prepares a recursive formulation of a Ramsey planner's problem with affine taxes in a risk-free-bond only economy. We  display
implementability conditions and two  Bellman equations associated with the planning problem.
 In section \ref{Sec: quasilinear}, we use these Bellman equations to characterize an optimal equilibrium in an economy with quasilinear preferences. In section \ref{sec: longrun anatyt},  we use them to study asymptotic outcomes under more general preferences.     In section \ref{Sec: numerical}, we use numerical solutions of these Bellman equations to study a calibrated economy.


 We now assume that $U^{i}:\mathbb{R}%
_{+}^{2}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is concave in $\left( c,-l\right) $ and
twice continuously differentiable. We let $U_{x,t}^{i}\ $or $U_{xy,t}^{i}$
denote first and second derivatives of $U^{i}$ with respect to $x,y\in
\left\{ c,l\right\} $ in period $t$ and assume that $\lim_{x\rightarrow \bar{%
l}_{i}}U_{l}^{i}\left( c,x\right) =\infty ,$ $\lim_{x\rightarrow
0}U_{l}^{i}\left( c,x\right) =0$ for all $c$ and $i.$

\subsection{Implementability conditions\label{Sec: impl and Bellman}}

We focus on  interior equilibria. First-order necessary conditions for the  consumer's problem
 are%
\begin{equation}
\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta _{i,t}U_{c,t}^{i}=-U_{l,t}^{i}
\label{FOC consumption labor}
\end{equation}%
and%
\begin{equation}
U_{c,t}^{i}=\beta(s_t) R_{t}\mathbb{E}_{t}U_{c,t+1}^{i}.  \label{FOC Euler}
\end{equation}%
To help characterize an equilibrium, we use

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop: affine eqm nec and suff}A sequence $\{ \left \{
c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i},R_{t},\tau _{t},T_{t}\}_t$ is part of
a competitive equilibrium with affine taxes if and only if it satisfies (\ref%
{feasibility goods}), (\ref{agent bc affine}), (\ref{FOC consumption labor}%
), and (\ref{FOC Euler}) and $b_{i,t}$ is bounded for all $i$ and $t.$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Necessity is obvious. In the appendix \ref{appndx: affine eqm nec and stuff}, we use arguments of \cite{Magill1994} and \cite{Constantinides1996} to show that any $\left \{
c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i,t}$ that satisfies (\ref{agent bc
affine}), (\ref{FOC consumption labor}), and (\ref{FOC Euler}) is a solution
to consumer $i$'s  problem. Equilibrium $\{B_{t}\}$ is determined by
(\ref{feasibility bonds}) and constraint (\ref{govmt bc affine}) is then
implied by Walras' Law
\end{proof}

\smallskip

To find an optimal equilibrium, by Proposition  \ref{prop: affine eqm nec and suff}
we can choose $\{ \left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i},R_{t},\tau
_{t},T_{t}\}_{t}$ to maximize (\ref{govmt objective}) subject to (\ref{feasibility goods}), (\ref{FOC consumption labor}), and (\ref{FOC Euler}).
% The last two constraints determine $\left \{ R_{t},\tau _{t}\right \}
%_{t} $ and are not featured anywhere else in maximization, so the
%allocations can be optimized over $\{\left \{
%c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i},,T_{t}\}_t$ which often simplifies
%optimization.
We  apply a first-order approach and follow steps similar to ones taken by \cite{LucasJr.1983} and AMSS.
 Substituting consumers' first-order
conditions (\ref{FOC consumption labor})\ and (\ref{FOC Euler})\ into the
budget constraints (\ref{agent bc affine}) yields implementability
constraints%
\begin{equation}
c_{i,t}+b_{i,t}=-\frac{U_{l,t}^{i}}{U_{c,t}^{i}}l_{i,t}+T_{t}+\frac{%
U_{c,t-1}^{i}}{\beta(s_{t-1}) \mathbb{E}_{t-1}U_{c,t}^{i}}b_{i,t-1}\ \text{for\ all\ }%
i,t.  \label{affine implementability a}
\end{equation}

\noindent For $I\geq 2$, we can use constraint (\ref{affine implementability
a}) for  $i=1$ to eliminate $T_{t}$ from (\ref{affine implementability a}) for $i > 1$. Define $\tilde{b}%
_{i,t}\equiv b_{i,t}-b_{1,t}$ and represent the implementability constraints
as
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\left( c_{i,t}-c_{1,t}\right) +\tilde{b}_{i,t}
\label{affine implementability b} \\
&=&-\frac{U_{l,t}^{i}}{\theta _{i,t}U_{c,t}^{i}}\left( \theta
_{i,t}l_{i,t}-\theta _{1,t}l_{1,t}\right) +\frac{U_{c,t-1}^{i}}{\beta(s_{t-1}) \mathbb{E}%
_{t-1}U_{c,t}^{i}}\tilde{b}_{i,t-1}\ \text{for\ all\ }i>1,t.  \notag
\end{eqnarray}%
\smallskip With this representation of the implementability constraints, the planner's
maximization problem depends only on the $I-1$ variables $\tilde{b}_{i,t-1}.$
The reduction of  the dimensionality from \ $I$ to $I-1$ is
 another consequence of theorem \ref{theorem: main}.

Let $\mathbf{x}= \beta^{-1}\left( U_{c}^{2}\tilde{b}_{2},...,U_{c}^{I}\tilde{b}_{I}\right)$, $\mathbf{\rho }=\left( U_{c}^{2}/U_{c}^{1},...,U_{c}^{I}/U_{c}^{1}\right) $, and denote an allocation $a=\{c_i,l_i\}^{I}_{i=1}.$ 
In the spirit of \cite{Kydland1980} and \cite{Farhi2010}, we split the problem into a time-0 problem that takes $(\{\tilde{b}_{i,-1}\}^{I}_{i=2}, s_0)$ as given and   a time $t \geq 1$ continuation problem  that takes $x,\rho,s\_$ as given. We formulate
two Bellman equations and two value functions, one that pertains to $t\geq 1$, another for $t=0$.

\smallskip
%\textcolor{blue}{Anmol: I have changed both the Bellman equations to incorporate $\beta$ shocks inline of David's suggestion}
For $t\geq1$, let $V(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\rho },s\_)$ be the continuation value to the planner given $x_{t-1}=x,\rho_{t-1}=\rho,s_{t-1}=s\_$. It satisfies the Bellman equation
%\textcolor{green}{David:  It seems to me that given that this is the Bellman equation we expect readers to refer to throughout the paper it might be good to allow for the possibility of discount factor shocks.  In which case the implementability should be

\section{Quasi-linear preferences\label{Sec: quasilinear}}

\smallskip
Before we use the section \ref{Sec: characterization}  Bellman equations, this section restricts preferences in a way that allows us to get a long way analytically and to identify
key forces that drive outcomes and that  distinguish them from what emerge in  representative agent economies.
In particular, we use  quasi-linear preferences\footnote{These preferences without the nonnegativity constraint on consumption have been studied in
the context of representative
agent economies.
See  AMSS, \cite{Farhi2010}, \cite{Battaglini2007,Battaglini2008}, \cite{Yared2012}, \cite{Faraglia2011}.}
\begin{equation}
U^{i}\left( c,l\right) =c-h_{i}(l),  \label{quasilinear}
\end{equation}%
where $h_{i}$ is an increasing differentiable function with $h_{i}^{\prime
}\left( 0\right) =0$ and $h_{i}^{\prime }\left( \bar{l}_{i}\right) =\infty $.
We restrict consumption  to be non-negative
\begin{equation}
c\geq 0.  \label{c ge c_lowbar}
\end{equation}%
 %One well-known benchmark is the analysis
%of AMSS\ of the optimal response to $g$ shocks, which shows that in the
%optimum the government accumulates assets until it can finance all future
%government expenditures from interest income. Taxes on labor income follow a
%random walk-like process that converges to zero.

We divide our presentation   into two parts. First, we
consider the optimal response to expenditure shocks in our heterogenous agent
economy in which optimal equilibria are interior in the sense that  constraint (\ref{c ge c_lowbar}) does not bind. %We show   differences in an optimal
%government policy  vis-a-vis the one that prevails in an AMSS economy. %These differences come from the  government's ability  to set transfers
%optimally in  our economy.
We show that while  equilibrium dynamics in AMSS\ are
driven by the exogenous restriction that transfers are non-negative,  with a sufficiently redistributive government in
a heterogenous agent economy  like ours, such
constraints are not present. Furthermore, if they were present, they might not bind.  That leads to substantially different  optimal policies.


\textcolor{blue}{In the second part of this section, we study in detail how optimal policy trades off concerns for redistribution and distortionary costs associated with affine taxes. By paying attention to equilibriums that are not interior, meaning that constraint (\ref{c ge c_lowbar}) binds in
some states we describe a force
present in economies with heterogeneous %risk-neutral
agents, namely, that a
reduction in transfers can lead to an increase in inequality and a
decrease in welfare. This type of welfare loss is not present in
representative agent economies. The next section describes how the government manipulates changes in net asset holdings to minimize these costs overtime}

\subsection{The optimal response to government expenditure shocks}\label{sec: quasi linear interior }

\smallskip To contrast outcomes in our environment with those in AMSS's, we
temporarily restrict our attention to economies with  shocks only  to $g_{t}$. So for now, $\beta$ and $\{\theta_i\}_i$ do not vary with $s_t$.
We assume that parameters and initial conditions are such that constraint (\ref{c ge c_lowbar})\ does not bind for any type $i$.
This will be true if the government puts a sufficiently high Pareto
weight on low productivity types and the shocks to $g$ are not too high.\footnote{ In
  section \ref{sec: Non Interior Eqb}, we show these conditions explicitly when agents have CES disutility from labor.} To simplify notation, we now assume that the initial debt is $%
\left\{ \beta ^{-1}b_{i,-1}\right\} _{i}.$

\begin{proposition}

\begin{proof}
When an equilibrium allocation is interior, the interest rate $R_{t}=\beta
^{-1}$ for all $t$ and % the necessary condition for compatitive equilirbium
%is
$\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta _{i}=h_{i}^{\prime }(l_{i,t})$ for all $%

component of the allocation as a function of $\left( 1-\tau \right) $ and to
optimize with respect to $\tau $ rather than $\left\{ l_{i}\right\} _{i}.$
We  invert  $h_{i}^{\prime }(\cdot )$ to express labor supply $%
l_{i}$ as a function of $\left( 1-\tau \right) .$ Call this function $%
H_{i}\left( 1-\tau \right) $.  Using this we can rewrite the implementability constraint (\ref{affine implementability b}) as

\begin{equation}
c_{i,t}-c_{1,t}+\tilde{b}_{i,t}-\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right)\left[ \theta_iH_{i}\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right)-\theta_1H_{1}\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right)\right]
=\beta ^{-1}\tilde{b}_{i,t-1}.  \label{affine imp quasi}
\end{equation}%

Given $\{\tilde{b}_{i,-1}\}_{i\geq2}$, the optimal policy solves

\begin{equation}

_{i}H_{i}\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \label{eq:res-quasi-interior}

Note that since $\left\{ \tilde{b}_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ is bounded,

\end{equation*}
By theorem \ref{theorem: main}, we can normalize $b_{1,t}=0 \quad t\geq-1$. This gives
\begin{equation}
c_{1,t}=\theta_i(1-\tau_t) H_i(1-\tau_t)+T_t.

Furthermore, multiplying by $\beta^t$ and summing \eqref{affine imp quasi}  over all $t$, we can re-write the objective as

 & \mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty } \sum_{i=2}^{I} \alpha _{i}\pi _{i}\beta ^{t}\left[ (1-\tau_t)\left\{ \theta_iH_{i}( 1-\tau_t)  - \theta_1H_{1}(1-\tau_t)  \right\}  -h_{i}\left( H_{i} (1-\tau_t ) \right)+ h_{1}\left( H_{1} (1-\tau_t )\right) \right]\\\nonumber
 & + \mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\beta^{t} \left[(1-\tau_t)\theta_1H_{1}(1-\tau_t )+T_t -h_1\left(H_{1} (1-\tau_t )\right)\right]+ \beta^{-1}\sum_{i=2}^{I}\beta^{-1}\tilde{b}_{i,-1} .
 \end{align}
Similarly, we can eliminate $c_{i,t}$'s from the implementability constraint \eqref{affine imp quasi} and obtain
\begin{equation}
 \sum_{i}\pi_i\theta_i H_i(\tau_t)-g_t-(1-\tau_t)\theta_1H_1(1-\tau_t)-T_t-\sum_{i=2}^{I}\left[(1-\tau)\left\{  \theta_iH_{i}( 1-\tau_t)  - \theta_1H_{1}(1-\tau_t) \right\} -\tilde{b}_{i,t} +\beta^{-1}\tilde{b}_{i,t-1}\right] =0  \label{eq: new imp quasi linear interior}
\end{equation}

Note that the revised objective \eqref{eq: new obj quasi linear interior} and the implementability constraint \eqref{eq: new imp quasi linear interior} are both  linear in $T_t$. The first order condition with respect to $T_t$  implies that the time $t$ multiplier $\mu_t\beta^t=\mu\beta^t \quad \forall t$.  Therefore, optimal tax rates $\tau _{t}^{\ast }$ are
also constant and independent of $t.$ Given $\tau^*_t$, constraint \eqref{eq: new imp quasi linear interior} pins down $T_t +\sum_{i=2}^{I}\tilde{b}_{i,t}-\beta^{-1}\tilde{b}_{i,t-1}$.  Without loss of generality, we can set the asset profiles to be constant and choose $T^*_t$ to satisfy equation (\ref{eq: new imp quasi linear interior}).

%\begin{equation}
 %\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty } \sum_{i=2}^{I} \alpha _{i}\pi _{i}\beta ^{t}\left[
 %(1-\tau_t)\left\{ H_{i}\left( 1-\tau_t \right) - H_{1}\left( 1-\tau_t \right)  \right} -h_{i}\left( H_{i}\left( 1-\tau_t \right) \right)+ h_{1}\left( H_{1} (1-\tau_t )  %\right]
%\end{equation}

 %\\\nonumber
 %& + \mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty } \left[H_{1,t}\left( 1-\tau_t \right)+T_t -h_1\right]+ \beta^{-1}\sum_{i=2}^{I}\beta^{-1}\tilde{b}_{i,-1}
%\end{align}



\end{proof}

\smallskip In the optimal equilibria for the quasi-linear economy described in Proposition \ref{Prop: quasilinear}, fluctuations in lump-sum taxes and
transfers ``do all the work''. In period 0, the government chooses an optimal
present value of transfers and a constant tax rate that pays for it. Tax rates  and transfers depend on the Pareto weights $\left\{ \alpha
_{i}\right\} $:  higher Pareto weights on low skilled agents imply
higher transfers and tax rates. In response to a shock $g_{t}$, the
government adjusts transfers in period $t$ by the amount of the shock. Since
all agents are risk-neutral,  welfare is unaffected by
fluctuations in transfers. This allows the government  perfectly to  smooth distorting tax rates.

\subsubsection{Comparison with representative agent economies} \label{sec: comp with AMSS}

The \cite{LucasJr.1983} and AMSS representative agent models
impose $T_{t}\geq 0$, a constraint that always binds in the Lucas and Stokey
model and that binds in the AMSS model  until the government has acquired enough
assets to finance all future expenditures from earnings on those assets. In those
representative agent models, the government would like to impose lump-sum \emph{taxes}, not
transfers. Distributional motives not present in those models, but present here, make things  different.
\smallskip

\smallskip Proposition \ref{Prop: quasilinear} shows that with quasi-linear preferences,  the dynamics of optimal
 tax rates, transfers,  and allocations in our economy differ starkly
 from those in representative agent Ramsey models like AMSS. To indicate how these differences are explained by concerns for redistribution and not the absence of exogenous restrictions on transfers, we impose an additional constraint in our maximization problem (\ref{AMSS max}), namely,
\begin{equation}
T_{t}\geq 0\text{ for all }t.  \label{T ge 0}
\end{equation}%
The following proposition states that our economy converges to an allocation similar to that characterized  in proposition \ref{Prop: quasilinear} where constraint \eqref{T ge 0} was slack \footnote{In  some settings with heterogenous
agents, for example, one with $\alpha_i >0$ for all $i$ and $\theta_1 = b_{1,-1} =0$, constraints (\ref{T ge 0}) is \emph{always} slack.}.
\smallskip

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:AMSS_killer1}
Assume that $I > 1$.
Let $\beta ^{t}\chi _{t}$ be the Lagrange multiplier on constraint (\ref{T
ge 0}) in a version of  maximization problem (\ref{AMSS max}) that is augmented with constraint (\ref{T
ge 0}). Then $\chi _{t}\rightarrow
0 $ a.s.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\smallskip Our augmented version of the maximization problem (\ref{AMSS max}) can be expressed
as maximization problem with an additional
constraint (\ref{T ge 0}). The first-order conditions for $T_{t}$ yield $%
\sum_{i=1}^{I}\alpha _{i}\pi _{i}=$ $\mu _{t}-\chi _{t}$, while the
first-order condition for $b_{i,t}$ implies $\mu _{t}=\mathbb{E}%
_{t}\mu_{t+1}.$ Since $\chi _{t}\geq 0,$ these two conditions imply
that $\chi _{t}$ is a nonnegative martingale and therefore $\chi _{t}$ must
almost surely converge to a constant. This, in turn, implies that $\mu _{t}$ must
almost surely converge to a constant. Then the first-order conditions for $\tau _{t}$
also imply that $\tau _{t}$ must converge a.s. to some $\tau ^{\ast }.$

Suppose $\chi _{t}\rightarrow \chi ^{\ast }>0.$ This implies that $%
T_{t}\rightarrow 0$ and (\ref{eq: new imp quasi linear interior}) becomes
\begin{equation}
 \sum_{i}\pi_i\theta_i H_i(\tau^{\ast})-g_t-(1-\tau)\theta_1H_1(1-\tau^{\ast})-\sum_{i=2}^{I}\left[(1-\tau^{\ast})\left\{ \theta_i H_{i}( 1-\tau^{\ast})  - \theta_1H_{1}(1-\tau^{\ast}) \right\} +B_{t} -\beta^{-1}B_{t-1}\right]=0  \label{eq: new imp quasi linear interior Tgeq0}
\end{equation}
where we used (\ref{feasibility bonds}) to substitute for $\sum_{i=2}^{I}\pi
_{i}b_{i,t}.$  If $g_{t}$ can take more than one value and follows an irreducible
Markov process, then for any bound on $B_{t}$, we can find a sequence of
government expenditures $g_{t}$ for which this bound will eventually be
violated, leading to a contradiction. This implies that $\chi
_{t}\rightarrow 0.$
\end{proof}



\smallskip Proposition \ref{Prop: quasilinear} and \ref{prop:AMSS_killer1} shed light on  the key force that
drives asymptotic outcomes in  AMSS for quasi-linear
preferences. Although constraint \eqref{T ge 0} need not bind in $I>1$ economies like ours, when $I=1$ it almost \emph{always} binds. %\footnote{%
%The exception is after the first-best outcome is eventually achieved in AMSS
%when the government has accumulated a   stock of assets sufficiently large to
%finance all subsequent expenditures.}
 Since the risk-free interest rate equals the
discount rate, a Ramsey planner %who faces constraint \eqref{T ge 0}
saves partly  to relax future constraints (\ref{T ge 0}), a
motive that endures until the planner has saved enough to render  slack all future
constraints \eqref{T ge 0}. Distortionary taxes $\tau^*_t$ are asymptotically zero.
%In the representative agent economy of
%AMSS with quasi-linear preferences, constraint (\ref{T ge 0}) binds  until the government has
%acquired enough assets that it never again has to set the tax rate $\tau_t >0$. %This explains the AMSS (2002) result that the government
%collects no taxes in the long run.
%\textcolor{green}{David: I've edited the last sentence to read as follows: }


In contrast, if the restriction that $T_t \geq 0$ is imposed when agents are heterogenous and the
government cares about redistribution,  the government will reallocate assets across  heterogeneous agents until the constraint $T_t \geq 0$ never again binds.  After that, the tax rate will typically be positive and the
continuation allocation will not be  first-best, in contradiction to the AMSS limiting outcome with quasi-linear preferences.
%\textcolor{red}{From Tom:  I have divided and edited the previous two sentences -- rewritten from David's last version.}

For quasi-linear preferences, figure \ref{fig: AMSS vs BEGS} compares equilibrium dynamics in a
representative agent (AMSS) economy and an economy with two agents, one who
is not productive, and  Pareto weights chosen to make
transfers be positive at all times  and along all  histories. The sequences of $s_t$ shocks are identical across the two economics.
 While tax rates converge to zero for the AMSS economy, they are constant for the heterogeneous agent economy.\footnote{The plots for the AMSS and the heterogeneous agent economies are both  for quasi-linear preferences with a Frisch elasticity of labor equals 0.5 and a discount factor $\beta=0.95$. In the AMSS economy,  the agent's  initial assets are zero  and  government expenditure shocks $g(s_t) \in\{.1,.3\}$ are generated using an IID process with equally likely outcomes.  For the heterogeneous agent economy, we set  $\alpha_2=.54$ so that the initial labor taxes are similar to those for the AMSS economy}. %The code is available at https://github.com/dgevans/AMSS.git.}

In this subsection, we specify fundamentals of our economy in  ways designed to illustrate the
role played by the Pareto planner's preferences for equality.
 We restrict ourselves to the case where $I=2$ , $\theta _{1}>\theta _{2}=0$ and CES disutility of labor $h_{1}\left( l\right) =\frac{1}{1+\gamma }%
l^{1+\gamma }$. We also maintain

 The following proposition characterizes the optimal policy in this environment
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop: quasilinear noninterior} Let $\tilde b_{2,t} = b_{2,t}-b_{1,t}$, under assumptions \ref {ass:positivelabor} and \ref{ass:nonemptyinterior},
\begin{enumerate}
 \item There exist $\left( \underline{\mathcal{%

\item If $\tilde{b}_{2,-1}<\underline{\mathcal{B}}_{2}\left( \alpha _{2}\right) ,$
then $\tilde{b}_{2,t}\rightarrow \underline{\mathcal{B}}_{2}\left( \alpha

\item The labor supplied by the productive type $1$ agent satisfies $h_{1}^{\prime }\left( l_{1,t}\right) \leq \mathbb{E}_{t}h_{1}^{\prime
}\left( l_{1,t+1}\right).
$
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}


\smallskip
This proposition highlights the link between the Pareto planner's  redistributive motive  and the evolution of (net) distribution of assets in a quasi-linear environment that  shuts down  interest rate fluctuations.  By theorem \ref{theorem: main}, we  can always normalize $%
b_{2,t}=0$ for all $t$, while  market clearing implies that $B_{t}=-b_{1,t}=\tilde{b}_{2,t},$ i.e., government assets equal minus the assets owned by high skilled agents. Start from an arbitrary Pareto weight  $\alpha_2$ on the low skilled  agent that measures how much the government cares about redistribution. The proposition states that there is a non-empty interval such that if  initial assets   are within it,  sample paths of debt, the tax rate, and  output are each constant sequences, and fluctuations in $g(s_t)$ are completely absorbed by transfers (see figure \ref{fig: AMSS vs BEGS} for instance). If  initial assets are  outside this interval, then assets eventually reach the boundary of the interval
to which initial assets are the closest,  then stay there.  Furthermore, as the government gets more redistributive, the interval
 $\left( \underline{\mathcal{%
B}}_{2}\left( \alpha _{2}\right) ,\mathcal{\bar{\mathcal{B}}}_{2}\left(
\alpha _{2}\right) \right) $ shifts leftward;  for large $\alpha_2$, the interval  can contain zero.  The quasilinear setup thus sets the stage for two features of optimal policy to emerge in economies with more general preferences: i) an inverse relationship between the level of government assets and the government's redistributive concerns; and ii) the government's incentives  to accumulate or decumulate assets.




 To reduce the adverse effects of  the non-negativity constraints on consumption, the government acquires claims against the productive agent. In response to adverse government expenditure shocks, the government raises the tax rate and
reduces transfers. The welfare costs of reducing transfers depend on   inequality in the
asset distribution  vis-a-vis the government's
re-distributive motives. When a government that cares  about the unproductive
agent but has  few claims on the productive agents\footnote{For example, think of a
a situation in which $\tilde{b}_{2}\approx \underline{%
\mathcal{B}}_{2}(\alpha _{2})$.}  reduces transfers, it increases the probability of hitting the unproductive agent's
lower bound on consumption and faces a high marginal cost. %\textcolor{red}{Anmol:  the previous sentence is unclear.  What is the `or' to complete
%the `either'?}
To avoid this, the optimal plan
is for the government to accumulate assets until it reaches a safe zone  where all
shocks to government expenditures  can be financed with fluctuations in transfers and constant  tax rates.
 In this safety zone,  the distortionary costs of transfers are zero.

%\textcolor{red}{XXXXX I edited the following paragraph.}
For all initial conditions, the long run asset level of the government is  bounded by $\left( \underline{\mathcal{B}}_{2}\left( \alpha
_{2}\right) ,\mathcal{\bar{\mathcal{B}}}_{2}\left( \alpha _{2}\right)
\right) $. Alongwith Part 2 of proposition \ref{prop: quasilinear noninterior}, this implies an inverse
 relationship between the government's redistributive motive  and its incentive to
accumulate assets. The intuition here is that when  the re-distributive
motive is large (i.e., as  $\alpha _{2}\rightarrow 1)$, the  constraint that threatens to bind
is the productive agent's consumption must be nonnegative. Since $\tilde{b}%
_{2}$ are the government's claims against the productive $i=1$ agent,  a smaller value of these
claims is required to assure that this nonnegativity constraint is satisfied. In this way, the non-negativity constraint on
$c_1(s)$  puts limits on $\bar{\mathcal{B}}_{2}(\alpha _{2})$.

In summary, to ameliorate non-negativity constraints on the consumption of an  agent whose Pareto weight is low, the optimal tax-transfer-debt policy  distributes assets  toward that agent  until a point is eventually  reached after which  all fluctuations in government expenditures can be absorbed by adjusting transfers and keeping distortionary taxes constant. 

%\textcolor{red}{XXXXXX Anmol and David -- I did some more editing of Anmol's good editing of June 18, 2013.}

 The quasi-linear setup also allows us to compare the forces for accumulating assets  in our model with those in
   representative agent models like AMSS. In section \ref{sec: comp with AMSS}, we argued that the presence of  a non-negativity constraint on transfers  motivates the government eventually to accumulate  assets in the  quasi-linear AMSS model.  The AMSS  model   approximates a version
   of our heterogeneous agent economy in which $\theta_1 > \theta_2 = 0$ as the planner's weight on the high skill type, $\alpha_1$, approaches 1.  Activating redistributive concerns by increasing the Pareto weight
 $\alpha_2$ on  the low skilled type 2 agent disarms the government's motive  to accumulate assets unless  initial government debt is very high.
 In the absence of nonnegativity  constraints on transfers, the dynamics of our heterogeneous agent model with quasi-linear preferences are driven by the non-negativity constraint \eqref{c ge c_lowbar} on consumption.

 In next section, we show that when agents are
risk averse with respect to consumption fluctuations, similar dynamics arise naturally from the fact that a decrease
in transfers generally affects low skilled agents more than high skilled
agents, leading to an increase in the difference between  their marginal utilities of
consumption. As we shall study in detail below,  when households are risk averse, another
force also affects  equilibrium dynamics, namely, endogenous interest rate fluctuations.

\label{sec: longrun anatyt}}

%\textcolor{red}{Tom XXXXX: write a transition here.}
%\textcolor{red}{Tom XXXXX: stopped here, June 26.}
%\textcolor{blue}{Anmol : I moved a few sentences to make a transition}
In this section, we analytically solve  a simple example economy that, while special, illustrates general forces that affect outcomes when agents are risk averse.
The example will help us  interpret  outcomes from numerical solutions of the section \ref{Sec: characterization} Bellman equations that
we shall report in section %
\ref{Sec: numerical}.

\smallskip There are  two types of households with $%
\theta _{1,t}>\theta _{2,t}=0$. One period utilities are $\ln c-\frac{1}{2}%
l^{2}.$ The shock $s$  takes  two values, $s\in \left\{
s_{L},s_{H}\right\} $ with probabilities $\Pr \left( s|s\_\right) $ that are
independent of $s_{-}.$ We assume that $g\left( s\right) =g$ for all $s,$
and $\theta _{1}\left( s_{H}\right) >\theta _{1}\left( s_{L}\right) .$ We allow the discount factor $\beta $ to depend on  $s.$

Let $\Psi \left( s;\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\rho },s\_\right) $ be an optimal  law of motion for the state variables
for the $t\geq1$ recursive problem, i.e. $\Psi \left( s;\mathbf{x},%
\mathbf{\rho },s\_\right) =\left( x^{\prime }\left( s\right) ,\rho ^{\prime
}\left( s\right) \right) $ that solve (\ref{eq:BM2}) given state $\left(
\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\rho },s\_\right) .$

\smallskip The next proposition shows the existence of a\textit{\ steady
state} $\left( x^{SS},\rho ^{SS}\right) $ that satisfies $\left( x^{SS},\rho
^{SS}\right) =\Psi \left( s;x^{SS},\rho ^{SS},s_{-}\right) $ for all $%
\,s,s\_.$ Since in this steady state $\rho =U_{c}^{i}(s)/U_{c}^{1}(s)$ does
not depend on the realization of shock $s,$ the ratio of marginal utilities
of the two agents is constant. The allocation depends only on  $s_{t}$ and not on the  history $s^{t-1}$.  Further, for CES preferences, separable in consumption and leisure, the tax rate on labor income is constant. These outcomes are reminiscent though not quite identical
 to those in a complete market economy (see Werning
2007).\footnote{The similarity is limited to the absence of  history dependence in the allocation  and constancy of the  ratio of marginal utilities (and also the labor tax rate for CES-separable preferences) that prevails in the stationary allocation. Typically, there does not exist an initial distribution of  assets  and list of Pareto weights for which the optimal allocation with complete markets will \emph{coincide} with the aforementioned stationary allocation with incomplete markets.}

%\textcolor{red}{Anmol XXXXXX: please look at how I edited the proposition.  Do you want to add the pointers to the

%
%\textcolor{blue}{Anmol : I think the pointers to figure that comes much later is a bit confusing. Its better to explain the connection to this proposition when we discuss the three lines later in the numerical section}

\smallskip  The key step of the proof, which appears in the appendix,  is
to show that there exists $\left( x,\rho \right) $ such that condition (\ref%
{eq:BM2_Imp_cons}) is satisfied for all $s.$

Proposition \ref{prop: long run forces} shows  two main forces that determine the dynamics of taxes
and assets. To describe the first force, it is useful to start  from the second part
of the proposition, which turns off what we shall call the second force,  namely, fluctuations in
interest rates. When  interest rates are fixed, the government can adjust two
instruments in response  to an adverse  shock (i.e., a fall in $\theta_1$): it can either increase the  tax rate $%
\tau $ or it can decrease transfers $T.$ Both  responses are distortionary,
but for different reasons. Increasing the tax rate increases distortions because the deadweight loss is convex in the tax rate,
 as in \cite{Barro1979}. This force operates in our economy just as it does in  representative agent economies.
 But in a  heterogeneous agent economy like ours,  adjusting transfers $T$ is
also costly. When agents' asset holdings are identical, a decrease in transfers  disproportionately
affects a low-skilled agent, so his marginal utility
falls by more than does the marginal utility of a high-skilled agent. Consequently, a
decrease in transfers increases inequality, a cost  not present in  representative agent economies.

The government can reduce the costs of  inequality distortions by choosing
tax rate policies that make the net asset positions of  the high skilled agent
decrease over time. That makes the two agents'
after-tax and after-interest income  get closer
together, allowing decreases in transfers to have smaller effects on inequality in
marginal utilities. If the net asset position of a high skilled agent is
sufficiently low, then a change in transfers has no effect on inequality and
all  distortions from fluctuations in transfers are eliminated.

It is possible to show numerically\footnote{Appendix \ref{apndx: numerical methods} describes a numerical test for existence and local stability cast in terms of  primitives.} that the steady state described in part
2 of  proposition \ref{prop: long run forces} is stable, so the  economy converges to it. This convergence outcome has
a similar flavor to "back-loading"\ results  of
\cite{Ray2002} and \cite{Albanesi2012} that reflect the  optimality of structuring policies intertemporally eventually to disarm  distortions.

Theorem \ref{theorem: main} provides  a useful way to compare our results with
 representative agent economies. By that theorem, we can normalize $%
b_{2,t}=0 $ for all $t$, in which case the negative of net assets of high-skilled agents can be
interpreted as assets of the government. Because $x^{SS}>0,$
the government  accumulates assets over time$,$ as in  AMSS.

Turning now to the second force,  interest rates generally fluctuate
with  shocks.  Parts 1 and 3 of  proposition \ref{prop: long run forces} indicate what drives those  fluctuations. Consider again the example of a
decrease in productivity of high skilled agent. If the  tax rate  $\tau $ is left unchanged,
the government faces a shortfall of revenues. Since
$g$ is constant, the
government requires  extra sources of revenues. But  suppose that
the interest rate increases whenever $\theta_1 $ decreases, as happens, for
example, when  discount factors are
constant and $\theta_1 $ is the only source of shocks. If the government holds positive assets, its earnings from those assets increase.
 So holding assets allows higher interest income
 to offset some of the government's revenue losses from taxes on labor.  The situation reverses if interest rates fall at
times of increased need for government revenues, as in
 part 3 of  proposition \ref{prop: long run forces} and the steady state allocation features government holding debt.

 What matters for our second force is the comovement of the interest rate with fundamentals shocks. States with low average TFP (and therefore a lower base for labor taxes), high $g$, or a high spread of productivities that threatens to induce higher inequality (and therefore higher  transfers and thirst for more  government  revenues to finance them) are ``adverse'' from the point of view of current government finance.
 %These are states in which, if there were no asset market and the government ran a balanced budget, the government would need to have a higher proportional tax rate in order to finance higher government expenditure, a lower tax base or transfers to counteract higher inequality.
 The government can cope with such adverse states in less distorting ways if finds itself holding positive (negative) assets if interest rates are  high (low).
 %\textcolor{red}{From Tom: I did a lot of surgery in the above paragraph and earlier in the section too.}

 %In that case, the government finance some of the required  extra revenues by its earnings from

%\textcolor{red}{From Tom: I have edited the above paragraph.  There is a new concept introduced here -- `needed government revenues'. This is
%seemingly distinct from g and includes transfers (and interest payments?).  I am a little worried that it is vague and the term is used in different ways in different places. Let's talk about this.}
%\textcolor{blue}{From anmol : I think we agreed on this terminology to have a parsimonius label for ``states'' when expenditure is high or productivity is low.

Depending on  details of shock processes, these two forces can
either reinforce each other (as happens in the Part 1 %\textcolor{red}{From Tom: can we label the part more precisely? Part 1?}
 of  proposition \ref{prop: long run forces}) or work in the opposite direction (as in Part 3 of  proposition \ref{prop: long run forces}). In the latter case, whether the
government ends up with assets or debt in the long run depends on the
relative strengths of the two forces. In section \ref{Sec: numerical},  we
calibrate shock processes to observed recessions to identify the long run asset
dynamics for the government.

Although we proved Proposition \ref{prop: long run forces} for a particular
specification of preferences and shocks, the same  messages continue to hold more
generally.  The only
place in the proof where we used the particular form of utility functions  was to prove an existence of a
solution to a particular equation that with our log-quadratic specification is  a quadratic that is
easy to solve analytically.  For other types of preferences, existence of a fixed point of the pertinent equation
can be  verified numerically.\footnote{Appendix \ref{apndx: numerical methods} describes a numerical test for existence and local stability cast in terms of  primitives.} When there are more than two possible values for the shocks or when
shocks are persistent, the time-invariant steady state  will no longer
exist. Mathematically, this occurs because one asset and one risk-free rate
of return cannot span all possible needs for government revenues. With
richer shock structures, there exists an attraction region in the  $(x,\rho)$ space   to which the dynamic
system  converges. Although $\left( x,\rho \right) $ are no longer
constant in such region, their fluctuations tend to be markedly
reduced relative to the transients that occur away from that region, and general properties of $x$ and $\rho$ are the same as those
described in Proposition \ref{prop: long run forces}. We will discuss these
issues in more details in the  section \ref{Sec: numerical}.

\section{\protect\smallskip Optimal policy in booms and recessions\label%
{Sec: numerical}}

\smallskip

Section \ref{sec: longrun anatyt} showed that the long run policy
response of the government depends on the nature of the shocks, in
particular, whether interest rates are high or low in periods which are ``adverse'' (low TFP, high inequality or high expenditure) from the point of view of governments budget constraint.

%on the correlation between the interest rate and the government's revenue
%requirements.
%\textcolor{red}{From Tom: Here the concept of `government's revenue
%requirements' makes an appearance. See my remark above. Let's clarify what it means.}
In this section, we further investigate this issue.
We focus on  optimal policy responses when the economy starts away
from the long-run steady state. We discuss  quantitative and qualitative
features of the response as well as the speed of convergence to the long-run
allocation by calibrating  shocks to match stylized facts about recent
recessions.

\smallskip We consider an economy with two types of agents%
\footnote{%
We restrict our attention to the economy with two agents for computational
tractability. We want to understand both short-run and long-run
responses to shocks.  For some of our computations,  it is important to allow our
dynamic systems to travel over a large subset of state space, including regions encountered infrequently.
With more agents, it seems  possible to apply other methods,  for example those of  \cite{Judd2011}, to study dynamics of our economy within its invariant
distribution. We hope to pursue such extensions in  future work.}
of equal measures with preferences%
\begin{equation*}
U\left( c,l\right) =\psi \ln c+\left( 1-\psi \right) \ln \left( 1-l\right) .
\end{equation*}%
The shock $s$   takes two values, $s_{H}$ and $s_{L}$, and follows a persistent
process. We allow $\beta ,$ $\theta _{i}$ and $g$ to be
functions of $s.$ We first pick $\bar{\theta}_{i},\bar{g}$
and $\bar{\beta}$ for a deterministic economy without shocks and calibrate $%
\left( \psi ,\alpha \right) $ to some low frequency  data moments. Then to match some business cycle moments we
pick shocks  according to
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:newstar}
\theta _{i}(s) &=&\bar{\theta}_{i}[1+{\hat{\theta}}_{i}(s)], \cr
\beta \left( s\right) &=&\bar{\beta}\left[ 1+\hat{\beta}(s)\right] , \cr
g\left( s\right) &=&\bar{g}\left[ 1+\hat{g}\left( s\right) \right] ,
\end{eqnarray}%
where $\hat{\theta}_{i}\left( s\right) \in \{-e_{i,\theta },e_{i,\theta }\},$
$\hat{\beta}\left( s\right) \in \{-e_{\beta },e_{\beta }\}$ and $\hat{g}%
\left( s\right) \in \left\{ -e_{g},e_{g}\right\} .$ Throughout  our
experiments, we normalize $b_{2,t}=0$ for all $t\geq -1$. From market
clearing,  $B_{t}=-b_{1,t}$.  We refer to $B_{t}$ as
government debt (when negative) and  assets (when positive).

\smallskip

\subsection{\protect\smallskip Calibration}

\smallskip We calibrate the model in two steps. We first chose baseline parameters
that govern preferences and technology so  that an optimal equilibrium for the static%
\footnote{%
Formally, an equilibrium in an economy where all shocks are forever equal to their
mean value} version of the economy matches some sample moments in post war US data.  In the second step, we adjusted other parameters  to make the amplitudes of
fluctuations equal to average peak-trough spreads observed in
the  three most recent recessions (1991-92, 2001-02 and 2008-10).

\smallskip
We first discuss calibration of $\left( \psi ,\alpha ,\bar{\theta}%
_{i},\bar{g},\bar{\beta}\right) $. Although these parameters jointly
determine the relevant moments, it is helpful  to explain which moment
in the data mainly influences each parameter.   We normalize $\bar{\theta}_{2}=1$
and pick $\bar{\theta}_{1}$ to match log wage ratio of 90 wage percentile to
10 wage percentile of 4 from \cite{Autor2008}. We set the discount factor $\bar{\beta}$
 to match an (annual) interest rate of 2\%. We set the parameter $\psi $
to match Frisch elasticity of labor supply equal to $0.5$. In our model, $%
\bar{g}$ corresponds to non-transfer government expenditures, which
in the U.S. varied from 7\%  and  11\% in the post WWII period  and were above 20\% during the war. We set
 $\bar{g}$ to 12\% of GDP. Finally, we set Pareto weights $\alpha $ to match the average
marginal tax rate in the US\ of about 20\% as in \cite{Chari1994}. \footnote{We use federal government expenditures (excluding current transfers) since the labor tax rate of 20\% in  \cite{Chari1994} is calibrated to federal marginal taxes.}

\smallskip Next we turn to some business cycle targets. We calibrate $\left\{
e_{i,\theta },e_{\beta},\Pr \left( s|s_{-}\right) \right\} $ to match the
following four facts about booms and recessions (using NBER dates, for the last 3 recessions ie 1991-92, 2001-02 and 2008-10) : the log of the  incomes individuals at  both the 10th and the 90th percentile falls  the recessions; 10th percentile income falls by
more than 90th percentile; an  inflation-adjusted interest rate on government
debt is generally lower in recessions; and  booms last longer
than recessions. We calibrate the average spread in labor productivity  to
match the average 3\% loss in output seen in the last three recessions.%
\footnote{%
It has long been noticed that the standard RBC model predicts counterfactual
negative correlation between real interest rates and output (e.g. \cite{Boldrin2001}). In the data HP filtered output is roughly uncorrelated with real
interest rates, but this relationship turn positive if we look at peak vs
troughs. We report the optimal responses for both economies with positive
and zero correlation of interest rates and output and contrast with a
response to a pure TFP\ shock.} The inequality shock is designed to match
the facts documented in \cite{NBERw18035} that the fall in earnings of
the 10-percentile is about 2.5 times of 90-percentile.
 The discount factor shocks
match the average boom-recession difference of about 1.96\% in the real
risk-free interest rate (3 month T bill rate - inflation rate) seen in the
last three recessions. We calibrate the transition matrix  to get match the
average duration of booms vs recessions.
 For comparison, we also calibrate a drop in government expenditure to get a
drop in output  similar to recessions induced by the productivity shocks

Note that because each of them is an
exact function of $s_t$, government expenditures, the discount factor, and productivities are
perfectly correlated: a recession is an episode in which  TFP falls, inequality
rises, and the discount factor is  high. We set the initial level of government debt to be 60\%, roughly to match the ratio of federal debt held by public at the
beginning of 2010.

\subsection{Outcomes}

\smallskip

\smallskip We discuss separately  long run and  short run implications
for  optimal policy. In particular, we  study the economy (\textbf{%
``Benchmark''} ) with the calibration discussed above and a few variants
that successively turn off particular sources of variation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Acyclical Interest Rates}: In the first variant, we recalibrate
the discount factor shocks to make the risk-free rate be uncorrelated with
output.

\item \textbf{Countercyclical Interest Rates}: Here we shut off  discount
factor shocks by setting $\hat{\beta}\left( s\right) =0$ in \eqref{eqn:newstar}. Note that under
this assumption, interest rates are countercyclical.

\item \textbf{No Inequality}: This variant modifies the \textquotedblleft
Benchmark\textquotedblright\ by setting $\hat{\beta}\left( s\right) =0$ and $%
{\hat{\theta}}_{1}(s)={\hat{\theta}}_{2}(s)=3\%$ in \eqref{eqn:newstar}. This corresponds to a case
when the only source of business cycle fluctuations is a TFP shock that
affects all agents equally. This case more closely matches the experiments
in the RBC\ literature such as \cite{Chari1994}.

\item \textbf{Government expenditure Shocks}: The last variant compares  optimal
responses to shocks to government expenditures. In this experiment, we set
$\hat{\theta}\left( s\right) =\hat{\beta}\left( s\right) =0$ and choose $%
\hat{g}\left( s\right) $ to produce a drop in output of a similar magnitude
to that in the first three experiments. This compares to the studies of
responses to government shocks by AMSS and \cite{Faraglia2011}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Long run}

experiments start with initial government debt to GDP\ ratio of 60\%. Several
features emerge from this figure. %First, as we discussed in Section \ref%
%{sec: longrun anatyt}, with the passage of time, the  economy converges to a particular region.

 \label{fig:LongSimulations}
 \end{figure}

\smallskip


In line with Section \ref{sec: longrun anatyt}, all four economies the state $(x,\rho)$   converge to some long run
ergodic set, so that government debt and the tax rate converge to associated sets. When there are no discount factor shocks
(See lines with {$\diamond$, \scriptsize  $\square$ \normalsize}in figure \ref{fig:LongSimulations}) or small discount factor shocks that produce acyclical interest rates (line with + in figure \ref{fig:LongSimulations} )
the government has accumulated assets in this ergodic set. As alluded to in section \ref{sec: longrun anatyt} %XXXXXX, \textcolor{red}{Please nail down the
 %section number.}
 the optimal policy adjusts  net asset
positions to ameliorate the two key constraints impinging  on the government policy, namely,
the inability to award agent-specific transfers (the restriction to \emph{affine taxes}) and the  absence of state-contingent assets (the
restriction to \emph {risk-free debt}). Starting from a point when the
relative assets of the low skilled agent (or the government if we use the
 normalization that sets $b_{2,t} = 0$) are low, extracting resources through lower
transfers exacerbates inequality. This is costly since the government has to
use higher taxes in future to redistribute. On the margin, the optimal policy requires the government (or low skill agent) to accumulate assets. But  interest rate
fluctuations interact with net asset positions to generate state-contingent  earnings
from assets. If interest rate are high when the government needs additional
revenues, accumulating assets relaxes the restriction imposed by absence
of state contingent assets. Thus, with countercyclical interest rates, these
forces reinforce each other, making the government's  long run asset position be positive.

In data, however, interest rates  generally decline in recessions. Procyclical interest rates mean that the
two forces outlined in the previous paragraph now oppose each other.  For  large enough interest rate fluctuations, this means that
the
government may want to accumulate debt. In Figure \ref{fig:LongSimulations}, the
black line represents the benchmark with discount factor shocks rigged to
replicate  procylical fluctuations in interest rates. For a particular initial condition for government debt,
the planner can refrain from varying debt for a very  long time.\footnote{Like the finding in Proposition \ref{prop: long run forces} for large discount factor shocks (in a way that interest rates are procylical)  there exist
regions where $x_t,\rho_t$ have low volatility and the  government is \emph{not} accumulating assets. But these
regions  are typically unstable. The two forces highlighted before that guide accumulation of assets now work in opposite direction and the net effect depends
on the relative strengths. In particular the sample paths from different initial conditions $\tilde{b}_{2,-1}$ (which would imply different choices for the initial $x_0,\rho_0)$ may display larger fluctuations in assets. However, at the calibrated initial conditions ($60\%$ debt-gdp ratio), the uncertainty associated with the mean path is very low for the first 5000 periods.} 


Convergence to the ergodic region is  very slow.  With persistent shocks and an initial 60\% debt-GDP\ ratio,  it takes about 3,000 years for
the government to want to pay off all that debt
and then start accumulating assets. With
discount factor shocks, it takes even longer to repay the debt. It is still indebted after 5000 years.

Thus, the covariance of interest rates with fundamentals as emphasized in proposition \ref{prop: long run forces} substantially influences the ergodic distribution of government assets.
%\textcolor{red}{From Tom: the previous sentence needs improvement -- please weigh in.}

\subsubsection{Short run}

The analysis of the previous subsection studied  aspects of very low
frequency components of  the optimal policy. Here  we focus on business cycle frequencies.
 In our setting,  these higher frequency responses can conveniently be divided  into the magnitudes of changes as we switch from ``booms''
to ``recession,'' and the dynamics during  periods when recession or boom state persist.

We set the exogenous state
$s_0$ so  that we are in an outset of a recession.  Then we  solve the time 0 problem with identical initial conditions across
different settings. This pins down the initial state vector  $x_0,\rho_0$  that appears in our time $0$ Bellman equation.
We then use the policy rules to compute fluctuations of
different components in the government budget constraint across states. These responses
are summarized in Table \ref{tab:ShortRunPolicyResponses}. For each variable
$z$ in the table we report in the form $\Delta z\equiv \left( z\left(
s_l|x_0,\rho_0,s_0\right) -z\left( s_h|x_0,\rho_0,s_0\right) \right) /\bar{Y}
$ where $\bar{Y}$ is average undistorted - GDP \footnote{%
Note that predetermined variables like repayment on existing debt drop out
of the accounting and we have
\begin{equation*}
\Delta [g]+\Delta[T]+ \Delta [B]=\Delta[\tau \theta_1 l_1]+ \Delta[\tau
\theta_2 l_2]
\end{equation*}%
}.

%variables in table ???-1.


%\textcolor{red}{Tom XXXXX: do some more rewriting of the following.}\textcolor{green}{David:  Agreed I think some signs were flipped tried a small rewrite} \textcolor{red}{XXXXXX: Nice job David. I did some minor writing touchups.}
The source of shocks is very important. Three different types of shocks
that produce similar drops in GDP  have very different consequences for optimal policies, both qualitatively and
quantitatively. %Note that there are significant qualitative and quantitative
%differences between TFP\ shock vs TPF and inequality shock.
In the benchmark, the government responds to a shock by a making big increases in transfers, the  tax rate, and  government debt. However, without inequality shocks (row 4), the government
responds by decreasing transfers and  increasing both debt and
the tax rate, but by an amount an order of magnitude smaller than the benchmark. This  indicates that ignoring distributional goals can produce a misleading view about  optimal government
policy in recessions.

\section{Concluding remarks\label{sec:conclude}}

  The spring of 2013 witnessed a heated debate in newspapers and economic magazines about the accuracy and meaning of empirical  correlations between output growth rates and
ratios of government debt to GDP and  in data sets assembled by \cite{Reinhart2010}.
From the  perspectives of our paper and of  \cite{Wer07a}, those correlations and those debates are especially difficult to interpret
because in our settings, total government debt is not a relevant state variable that affects allocations, government transfers, or tax rates.
The principal message of our paper  is that  without exogenous restrictions on transfers, the level of government debt is not what matters. What
 does matter is how government  debt is distributed among people relative to society's attitudes toward unequal allocations of consumption and labor.  Using a recursive representation that works with a correct state variables --- a vector of marginal utility adjusted net asset positions and a vector of pairwise ratios of marginal utilities  --  we have
 presented  a sequence of examples designed to show how  agents net positions affect optimal government policies for choosing distorting tax
 rates, transfers, and government issues or holdings of risk-free bonds. We find that a significant determinant of an optimal asymptotic government
 debt or government debt-GDP ratio is how interest rate risk is correlated with risks to fundamentals that threaten to widen or narrow
 inequality in after-tax and after-transfer incomes. To interpret those Reinhart-Rogoff facts country-by-country, we would
 want to know much more about the distribution of net assets across people within each country and how they interact with interest rate risks and other risks.

%\subsection{\protect \smallskip History-dependent taxes when asset taxes are
%not available\label{Sec: retroactive}}
%
%\smallskip
%
%The optimal tax schedule described in section \ref{sec:tax_opt_all} requires
%that the government can observe and tax assets of the households. When the
%government can do that, all impediments to optimality coming from
%preexisting debts and market incompleteness vanish. In period 0, the
%government can effectively redistribute assets as it wants and then can use
%asset taxes to assure that the distribution of assets never changes. There
%is never a distribution of asset holdings that is inefficient or that
%prevents the government from achieving the constrained optimal allocation.
%
%One objection to this characterization of an optimal tax policy is that in
%practice asset holdings of the households are not easily observed because
%many financial transactions are anonymous and hidden from the government.
%That makes taxation of assets difficult. In this section, we discuss the
%implications for optimal taxation that follow from a government's inability
%to tax assets when nevertheless it has access to an arbitrary non-linear tax
%$T_{t}\left( y_{t},...,y_{0}\right) $. Since consumption taxes can replicate
%asset taxes, we rule them out.
%
%\smallskip In the appendix, we state an optimal tax problem for general
%non-linear labor income taxes $T_{t}\left( y_{t},...,y_{0}\right) .$ We also
%characterize a particular example that exhibits the same features
%encountered in Section \ref{Sec: snl}, namely, that distortions and
%allocations generally depend on the history of past shocks and the initial
%distribution of net assets $\left \{ \tilde{b}_{i,-1}\right \} _{i=2}^{I}.$
%The example is basically a variant of the AMSS-like economy of Section \ref%
%{Sec: quasi-linear with risk aversion} where both agents can now work. We
%show that in that economy either the consumption of agent 1, $c_{1,t},$ must
%eventually hit the lower bound, as in the case of affine taxes, or the
%consumption of agent 2, $c_{2,t}$ must initially fluctuate but eventually
%converge to a constant. Both of those cases imply that optimal taxes and
%allocations depend not only on the current $g$ but also on its history.

%Proposition \ref{Prop: mechdes decentralize} shows that debt markets play no
%useful role when taxes are sufficiently flexible, and in particular when
%they can depend on the entire history of labor earnings. For then the
%government can effectively shut the debt market by taxing away all income if
%it observes that the agent uses this market. The government can then provide
%all insurance through the tax code.
%
%An optimal tax schedule can be less extreme. Various decentralizations
%popular in the literature use a continuous but non-linear tax on asset
%income, such as Werning (2012) or XXXX. Despite being continuous, these
%taxes effectively achieve the same goal as attained in the extreme example
%in Proposition \ref{Prop: mechdes decentralize}: they make it prohibitively
%costly for agents to depart from the allocation assigned by the planner.
%This result is not surprising, for it is known (see, for example, Golosov
%and Tsyvinski (2007)) that welfare in the mechanism design problems is lower
%when agents can trade freely or face linear returns on assets.
%
%In the economy with affine taxes considered in section \ref{Sec:
%quasi-linear with risk aversion}, debt markets played an important role.
%They allowed the agents and the government to smooth consumption and
%distortions in response to the aggregate shocks.
%
%The contrasting roles of debt markets in these two situations induces us to
%ask, ``when are debt markets useful?'' In general, unrestricted debt markets
%play two roles, one that is welfare decreasing, another that is welfare
%enhancing. Optimal non-linear income taxes are generally not convex. When
%agents can freely trade assets, they can convexity their budget sets. On the
%one hand, private asset trading improves the utility of each individual
%agent but it reduces the government's ability to redistribute and therefore
%lowers social welfare. This is why in the mechanism design problems it is
%welfare decreasing for agents to trade behind the planner's back. On the
%other hand, when the tax system is less than perfect, trading assets usually
%cannot provide an agent with an optimal amount of consumption smoothing. The
%affine taxes in section \ref{Sec: quasi-linear with risk aversion}
%illustrate that. If agents could not trade among themselves, consumption of
%the risk averse agent, $c_{2,t},$ would fluctuate much more, leading to
%welfare losses.
%
%Allowing taxes on current income to be non-linear, as in Section \ref{Sec:
%snl}, helps the government provide more insurance to agents through the tax
%code, although less than perfectly. As a result, whether welfare is higher
%in the economy in which agents can trade assets freely or in the economy in
%which agents cannot trade assets depends on which force dominates. It is
%easy to construct examples in which one or the other of these economies has
%higher welfare depending on the redistributive objectives of the government
%or the nature of the aggregate shocks. [\textbf{should we actually put an
%example of that?}] This highlights a general point. The more restricted is
%the available set of tax instruments, the more important it is for the
%agents to be able to trade assets freely. We conjecture that this point
%would be more important in economies with richer shock structures.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Additional details for Section \ref{Sec: extensions}}
\label{appndx: borrowing constraints example}
In this section we construct an example in which the government can achieve
higher welfare in the economy with ad-hoc borrowing limits.  We restrict ourselves to $I=2$, $\theta_1>\theta_2=0$, quasilinear preferences for Agent 1 : $U^1(c,l)=c-h(l)$ and a concave utility function (that satisfies Inada conditions) for Agent 2

\smallskip

Suppose that $g_{t}=0$ for all $t,$ so that the economy is deterministic. In addition, assume that $\underline{b}_{1}=0$ and $\underline{b}_{2}=-\infty .$ Given $\left( \beta ^{-1}{b}_{1,-1},\beta ^{-1}{b}%
_{2,-1},\beta ^{-1}{B}_{-1}\right) $, the optimal policy solves :

\begin{equation}
 \label{obj: borrowingconstexample}
 \max_{\left \{ c_{1,t},c_{2,t},l_{1,t},b_{1,t},b_{2,t},R_{t}\right \}
_{t}}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\beta ^{t}\left[ \alpha _{1}\left(
c_{1,t}-h(l_{1,t})\right) +\alpha _{2}U^2(c_{2,t})\right]
 \end{equation}
subject to

\begin{subequations}
 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:borrowingconstexample-imp}
c_{2,t}-c_{1,t}+b_{2,t}-b_{1,t}+h^{\prime }(l_{1,t})l_{1,t}=R_{t-1}\left(
b_{2,t-1}-b_{1,t-1}\right)
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:borrowingconstexample-res}
 c_{1,t}+c_{2,t}\leq \theta l_{1,t}
 \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:borrowingconstexample-euler1a}
 1\geq \beta R_t
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:borrowingconstexample-euler1b}
 (1-\beta R_t)b_{1,t}=0
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:borrowingconstexample-euler2}
 U^2_{c,t}=\beta R_t U^2_{c,t+1}
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:borrowingconstexample-limits}
 b_{1,t}\geq0
 \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

We solve this maximization problem in two stages. First, drop
constraint (\ref{eq:borrowingconstexample-euler1a}) and solve the resulting relaxed
problem  subject to the remaining
constraints for a fixed sequence of $\left \{ R_{t}\right \} _{t}.$ Denote
the value of the objective function for the reduced problem by $W\left(
\left \{ R_{t}\right \} _{t}\right) .$ Second, solve the original problem by
choosing $\ \left \{ R_{t}\right \} _{t}$ to maximize
\begin{equation*}
W\left( \left \{ R_{t}\right \} _{t}\right)
\end{equation*}%
subject to (\ref{eq:borrowingconstexample-euler1a}).

Let $\mu_t\beta^t \Pr(s^t)$ is Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint (\ref{eq:borrowingconstexample-imp})
 \begin{lemma}
 For $R_t=\beta^{-1}$, we can choose a  time invariant solution  $c_{1,t}= \bar{c}_{1},c_{2,t}=\bar{c}_{2},l_{1,t}=\bar{l}%
_{1},b_{1,t}=\bar{b}_{1},b_{2,t}=\bar{b}_{2}$ to the relaxed problem that satisfies
\begin{equation*}
\bar{b}_{2}-\bar{b}_{1}=\bar{b}_{2}=\bar{b}_{2,-1}-\bar{b}_{1,-1}.
\end{equation*}

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By Theorem \ref {theorem: main}, we can set $b_{1,t}=0$  and ignore constraint (\ref{eq:borrowingconstexample-limits}). Further ignoring constraint (\ref{eq:borrowingconstexample-euler2}), a stationary interior solution is given by

 \begin{subequations}
 \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:borrowingconstexample-foc-c2}
U^2_c[\bar{c}_2]=\frac{2\bar{\mu}+\alpha_1}{\alpha_2}
 \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:borrowingconstexample-foc-labor}
\alpha_1 h'(\bar{l}_1)=\theta_1\alpha_1+\bar{\mu}[\theta_1-h''(\bar{l}_1)\bar{l}_1-h'(\bar{l}_1)]
 \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:borrowingconstexample-foc-b_2}
b_{2,-1}=\frac{2\bar{c}_2+ \bar{l}_1\left[h'(\bar{l}_1)-\theta_1 \right] }{\beta^{-1}-1}
\end{equation}

 \end{subequations}


Note that if a solution to the above set of equations exists, (\ref{eq:borrowingconstexample-euler2}) is naturally satisfied.

We first establish some comparative statics with respect to $\bar{\mu}$. It is easy to see that concavity of $U^2$implies $\frac{\partial \bar{c}_2}{\partial \mu}<0$. Further equation (\ref{eq:borrowingconstexample-foc-labor}) can be rearranged to get

 \[\frac{h'(\bar{l}_1)}{\theta_1}=\frac{\alpha_1+\bar{\mu}}{\left[\alpha_1+\bar{\mu}+\bar{\mu}\left(\frac{h''(\bar{l}_1)\bar{l}_1}{h'(\bar{l}_1)}\right)\right]}\]

 Using convexity of $h$ we have $\frac{\partial \bar{l}_1}{\partial \mu}<0$.

 As $\bar{\mu}\to -\frac{\alpha_1}{2}$, the RHS of (\ref{eq:borrowingconstexample-foc-b_2}) approaches $+\infty$ and $\bar{\mu}\to + \infty$ it approaches some $\underline{b}_2<0$. Thus we have a stationary solution for a range of $b_{2,-1}$. \footnote{We may need additional restrictions for non-negativity of $c_1$. Alternatively we could allow Agent 1's consumption to take negative values }

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
 For $R_t=\beta^{-1}$, if $b_{2,-1}<b_{1,-1}$ then $\bar{\mu}>0$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 Suppose $\bar{\mu}\leq0$ when $b_{2,-1}<b_{1,-1}$.  At $\mu=0$, $h'(\bar{l}_1)=\theta_1$  and the RHS of (\ref{eq:borrowingconstexample-foc-b_2}) is positive.  At $\mu<0$ we have $h'(\bar{l}_1)>\theta_1$ . The observations above imply that the RHS of (\ref{eq:borrowingconstexample-foc-b_2}) is increasing in $\mu$ and this clearly violates equation (\ref{eq:borrowingconstexample-foc-b_2}).  Thus we have a contradiction.
 \end{proof}
\smallskip

When $R_{t}=1/\beta $ for all $t,$
the solution of the reduced problem is an optimal allocation for an economy
in which agents face no borrowing constraints

Let $\left. \frac{\partial }{\partial R_{1}}W\left( \left \{ R_{t}\right \}
_{t}\right) \right \vert _{\left \{ R_{t}\right \} =\mathbf{\beta }^{-1}}$
be the derivative of $W\left( \left \{ R_{t}\right \} _{t}\right) $ with
respect to $R_{1}$ evaluated at $R_{t}=\beta ^{-1}$ for all $t$. Our
observations above imply that
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{\partial }{\partial R_{1}}W\left( \left \{ R_{t}\right \}
_{t}\right) \right \vert _{\left \{ R_{t}\right \} =\mathbf{\beta }^{-1}}=%
\bar{\mu}\bar{b}_{2,t}=\bar{\mu}\left( \bar{b}_{2,-1}-\bar{b}%
_{1,-1}\right) <0
\end{equation*}
and therefore $R_{t}=\beta ^{-1}$ for all $t$ is not the optimal equilibrium
sequence. Therefore, welfare in the economy with exogenous borrowing
constraints is strictly higher than in the economy without exogenous
borrowing constraints.\footnote{%
The mechanism in this example is similar to a finding of \cite{Yared2010}, who
showed that relaxing agents' borrowing constraints can be suboptimal in an
economy with idiosyncratic shocks. Our analysis shows that this insight is
more general and holds even in economies with no shocks.}

The outcome that welfare can be strictly higher with exogenous borrowing
constraints depends on our assumption that agents dont face idiosyncratic risk . If agents were also subject to idiosyncratic shocks,
exogenous borrowing constraints would have the additional effect of limiting
agents' ability to self-insure against those shocks.\footnote{%
See \cite{Aiyagari1998} and \cite{Heathcote2005} for details.}
Nevertheless, the insight from the example carries through that even though exogenous
borrowing constraints can hurt agents' to insure against idiosyncratic shocks, they
can help a government smooth distortions with respect to aggregate shocks
like government expenditure shocks.

\subsection{\smallskip Proof of Proposition  \ref{prop: affine eqm nec and suff}}
\label{appndx: affine eqm nec and stuff}
\smallskip

We prove a slight more general version of our result. Consider an infinite
horizon, incomplete markets economy in which an agent maximizes utility
function $U:\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ subject to an infinite
sequence of budget constraints. We assume that $U$ is concave and
differentiable. Let $\mathbf{a}(s^t)$ be a vector of $n$ goods and let $%
\mathbf{p}(s^{t})$ be a price vector in state $s^{t}$ with $p_{i}(s^{t})$
denoting the price of good $i.$ We use a normalization $p_{1}\left(
s^{t}\right) =1$ for all $s^{t}.$ There is a risk-free bond.

Let $b(s^{t})$ be the agent's bond holdings, and let $\mathbf{e}\left(
s^{t}\right) $ be a stochastic vector of endowments.

\textbf{Consumer maximization problem}


\begin{equation}
\max_{\mathbf{a}_{t},b_{t}}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^t \beta(s_j)\bigr]\Pr \left(
s^{t}\right) U(\mathbf{a}\left( s^{t}\right) )
\label{Tech appendix: consumer maximization}
\end{equation}%
subject to%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{p}\left( s^{t}\right) \mathbf{a}\left( s^{t}\right) +q(s^{t})b\left(
s^{t}\right) =\mathbf{p}\left( s^{t}\right) \mathbf{e}\left( s^{t}\right)
+b\left( s^{t-1}\right)  \label{Tech appendix: budget constraint}
\end{equation}%
and $\left \{ b\left( s^{t}\right) \right \} $ is bounded and $\left \{
q(s^{t})\right \} $ is the price of the risk-free bond.

The Euler conditions are%
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{U}_{a}(s^{t}) &=&U_{1}(s^{t})\mathbf{p}(s^{t})
\label{Tech appendix: Euler} \\
\Pr \left( s^{t}\right) U_{1}\left( s^{t}\right) q(s^{t}) &=&\beta(s_t)
\sum_{s^{t+1}>s^{t}}\Pr \left( s^{t+1}\right) U_{1}\left( s^{t+1}\right) .
\notag
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{lemma}
\smallskip Consider an allocation $\left \{ \mathbf{a}_{t},b_{t}\right \} $
that satisfies (\ref{Tech appendix: budget constraint}), (\ref{Tech
appendix: Euler}) and $\left \{ b_{t}\right \} _{t}$ is bounded. Then $%
\left
\{ \mathbf{a}_{t},b_{t}\right \} $ is a solution to (\ref{Tech
appendix: consumer maximization}).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof follows closely \cite{Constantinides1996}. Suppose there is
another budget feasible allocation $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{h}$ that maximizes (%
\ref{Tech appendix: consumer maximization}). Since $U$ is strictly concave,
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^t \beta(s_j)\bigr]U(\mathbf{a}_{t}+\mathbf{h}%
_{t})-\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^t \beta(s_j)\bigr]U(\mathbf{a}_{t})
\label{Tech appendix: gain from h} \\
&\leq &\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^t \beta(s_j)\bigr]\mathbf{U}_{a}(\mathbf{a}%
_{t})\mathbf{h}_{t}  \notag
\end{eqnarray}

To attain $\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{h}$, the agent must deviate by $\varphi _{t}$
from his original portfolio $b_{t}$ such that $\left\{ \varphi _{t}\right\}
_{t}$ is bounded$,$ $\varphi _{-1}=0$ and
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{p}(s^{t})\mathbf{h}\left( s^{t}\right) =\varphi
(s^{t-1})-q(s^{t})\varphi (s^{t})
\end{equation*}%
Multiply by $\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^{t-1} \beta(s_j)\bigr]\Pr \left( s^{t}\right) U_{1}(s^{t})$ to get:%
\small
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^{t-1} \beta(s_j)\bigr] \Pr \left( s^{t}\right) U_{1}(s^{t})\mathbf{p}(s^{t})\mathbf{h}%
\left( s^{t}\right)  &=&\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^{t-1} \beta(s_j)\bigr]\Pr \left( s^{t}\right)
U_{1}(s^{t})\varphi (s^{t-1})-q(s^{t})\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^{t-1} \beta(s_j)\bigr] \Pr \left( s^{t}\right)
U_{1}(s^{t})\varphi (s^{t}) \\
&=&\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^{t-1} \beta(s_j)\bigr] \Pr \left( s^{t}\right) U_{1}(s^{t})\varphi (s^{t-1})-\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^{t-1} \beta(s_j)\bigr]\beta(s_t)\sum_{s^{t+1}>s^{t}}\Pr \left( s^{t+1}\right) U_{1}\left(
s^{t+1}\right) \varphi (s^{t})
\end{eqnarray*}%
\normalsize
where we used the second part of (\ref{Tech appendix: Euler}) in the second
equality. Sum over the first $T$ periods (pathwise) and use the first part of (\ref {Tech appendix: Euler}) to eliminate $\mathbf{U}_{a}(\mathbf{a}%
_{t})=U_{1}(s^{t})\mathbf{p}(s^{t})$%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{t=0}^{T}\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^{t-1} \beta(s_j)\bigr] \Pr \left( s^{t}\right) \mathbf{U}_{a}(\mathbf{a}%
_{t})\mathbf{h}\left( s^{t}\right) =-\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^{T} \beta(s_j)\bigr] \sum_{s^{T+1}>s^{T}}\Pr
\left( s^{T+1}\right) U_{1}\left( s^{T+1}\right) \varphi (s^{T}).
\end{equation*}%
Since $\left\{ \varphi _{t}\right\} _{t}$ is bounded there must exist $\bar{%
\varphi}$ s.t. $|\varphi _{t}|\leq \bar{\varphi}$ for all $t$. By Theorem
5.2 of Magill and Quinzii (1994), this equilibrium with debt constraints
implies a transversality condition on the right hand side of the last
equation, so by transitivity we have%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{T\rightarrow \infty }\sum_{t=0}^{T}\bigl[\Pi_{j=0}^{t-1} \beta(s_j)\bigr]\Pr \left( s^{t}\right)
\mathbf{U}_{a}(\mathbf{a}_{t})\mathbf{h}\left( s^{t}\right) =0.
\end{equation*}%
Substitute this into (\ref{Tech appendix: gain from h}) to show that $%
\mathbf{h}$ does not improve utility of consumer.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Proof of Proposition \protect\ref{prop: quasilinear noninterior}}

\smallskip Let $\alpha _{2}$ be the Pareto weight on the unproductive agent.
Given a (initial) net distribution of assets $\tilde{b}_{2}=b_{2}-b_{1}$ the
optimal solution solves the following Bellman equation.

\begin{equation}
V(\beta^{-1}\tilde{b}_2,s\_)=\max_{c_1(s),c_2(s),l_1(s),\tilde{b}_2^{\prime }(s)}
\sum_{s}\Pr(s|s\_) \left \{ (1-\alpha_2)\left(c_1(s)-h[l_1(s)]\right)+\alpha_2
c_2(s) +\beta V(\beta^{-1} \tilde{b}^{\prime }_2(s),s)\right\}
\label{eq:QuasiLinearProblem}
\end{equation}

subject to
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
c_2(s)-c_1(s)+\tilde{b}^{\prime }_2(s)+ l_1(s)h^{\prime }[l_1(s)]=\frac{%
\tilde{b}_2}{\beta}  \label{eq:QLImp}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
c_2(s)+c_1(s)+g(s)\leq\theta_1l_1(s)  \label{eq:QLResource}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
c_1(s)\geq 0\quad c_2(s)\geq0  \label{eq:QLconsbounds}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\tilde{b}_2^{\prime }(s)\in [\underline b,\bar b]
\end{equation}

Let $\mu(s)\Pr(s|s\_) , \xi(s)\Pr(s|s\_)$ , $\lambda^{c_i}(s)\Pr(s|s\_)$ be the
multipliers on the implementability (\ref{eq:QLImp}), resource constraint (\ref{eq:QLResource}) and the non-negativity constraints (\ref{eq:QLconsbounds})
for the respective consumption. For now we assume that $\underline b$ and $%
\bar b$ are natural debt limits and ignore them on the equilibrium path. The
FONCs of the problem are
\end{subequations}

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
1-\alpha_2+\mu(s)+ \lambda^{c_1}(s)-\xi(s)=0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\alpha_2 -\mu(s)+ \lambda^{c_2}(s)-\xi(s)=0
\end{equation}
Let $g(l)=lh^{\prime \prime }(l)+h^{\prime }(l)$
\begin{equation}
-(1-\alpha_2)h^{\prime }[l_1(s)]-\mu(s)g[l_1(s)]+\theta_1\xi(s)=0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mu(s)=V_{\tilde{b}_2}[\tilde{b}^{\prime }_2(s),s]
\end{equation}
and lastly the Envelope theorem gives us

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}_{s\_} V_{\tilde{b}_2}[\tilde{b}^{\prime }_2(s),s]=V_{\tilde{b}_2}[%
\tilde{b}_2,s\_]
\end{equation}

For an interior solution,i.e $c_1(s)>0, c_2(s)>0$, we have constant labor
supply that solves the following equation

\end{subequations}

\begin{equation}
-(1-\alpha_2)h^{\prime }(l_1)-(\alpha_2-\frac{1}{2})g(l_1)+\frac{\theta_1}{2}%
=0
\end{equation}

For CES labor disutility, $h(l)=\frac{l^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}$, this yields

\begin{equation}
l^{*}_1\left(\alpha_2\right)=\left(\frac{\theta_1}{2\left[\left(\alpha_2-%
\frac{1}{2}\right)(1+\gamma)+(1-\alpha_2) \right ]}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}
\label{eq:QLLabor}
\end{equation}

The condition $\alpha_2\geq \frac{(\gamma-1)}{2\gamma}$ ensures that $%
l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right)\geq0$

We can use the implementability constraint (\ref{eq:QLImp}) with the guess $%
\tilde{b}^{\prime }_2(s)=\tilde{b}_2$ and the resource constraint (\ref%
{eq:QLResource}) to back out consumptions for each agent.

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
c_1(s)=\frac{1}{2}\left[ \theta_1l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right)
+l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right)h^{\prime }(l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right))-\tilde{b}%
_2 \left(\frac{1}{\beta}-1\right)-g(s)\right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
c_2(s)=\frac{1}{2}\left[ \theta_1l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right)
-l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right)h^{\prime }(l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right))+\tilde{b}%
_2 \left(\frac{1}{\beta}-1\right)-g(s)\right]
\end{equation}

To be a valid interior solution we need $\tilde{b}_2\in \left[ \underline{%
\mathcal{B}}_2\left(\alpha_2\right) , \bar{\mathcal{B}}_2\left(\alpha_2%
\right) \right]$ where this interval is given by

\end{subequations}

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\underline{\mathcal{B}}_2\left(\alpha_2\right)=\frac{\max_{s}g(s)-\theta_1
l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right)+l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right)h^{\prime
}(l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right))}{\frac{1}{\beta}-1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:QLLowerLimit}
\bar{\mathcal{B}}_2\left(\alpha_2\right)=\frac{-\max_{s}g(s)+\theta_1
l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right)+l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right)h^{\prime
}(l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right))}{\frac{1}{\beta}-1}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

The condition for non-empty interior is a very natural one $%
-\max_{s}g(s)+\theta_1 l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right)>0$, that says that output
sufficient to cover the worst possible realization of government consumption.

\begin{lemma}
$\underline {\mathcal{B}}_2(\alpha_2)$ and $\bar {\mathcal{B}}_{2}(\alpha_2)$
are decreasing in $\alpha_2$
\end{lemma}

Using the expression \ref{eq:QLLabor} for $l_1^*(\alpha_2)$, we have

\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:lowerlimit}
\underline {\mathcal{B}}_{2}^{\prime }(\alpha_2)=\frac{\partial
l_1^*(\alpha_2)}{\partial \alpha_2}\left[(1+\gamma){l_1^*}^{\gamma}(\alpha_2)-%
\theta_1\right]
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\bar {\mathcal{B}}_{2}^{\prime }(\alpha_2)=\frac{\partial l_1^*(\alpha_2)}{%
\partial \alpha_2}\left[(1+\gamma){l_1^*}^{^\gamma}(\alpha_2)+\theta_1\right]
\end{equation*}

Its easy to see that $l_1^*(\alpha_2)$ is decreasing in $\alpha_2$. For the
range $\alpha_2\geq \frac{\gamma-1}{2 \gamma}$ it is also non-negative. It
suffices to show that the term $\left[(1+\gamma){l_1^*}^{\gamma}(\alpha_2)-%
\theta_1\right]$ is non-negative. Note that

\begin{equation*}
\max_{\alpha_2\in[0,1]} \left(\alpha_2-\frac{1}{2}\right)(1+\gamma)+(1-%
\alpha_2) ]=1+\gamma
\end{equation*}

Thus ${l_1^*}^{\gamma}(\alpha_2)(1+\gamma)\geq\theta_1$.

Now we show that for large $\alpha_2$, the interval  $\left[ \underline{%
\mathcal{B}}_2\left(\alpha_2\right) , \bar{\mathcal{B}}_2\left(\alpha_2%
\right) \right]$ can contain zero.

\begin{lemma}
If $\max_{s}g(s)<\theta_1^{\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}} \left(\frac{1}{1+\gamma}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}\left(\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}\right)$, then
\[\lim_{\alpha_2\to1}\underline{\mathcal{B}}(\alpha_2)<0\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 Note that $\lim_{\alpha_2\to 1}l_1^*(\alpha_2)=\left(\frac{\theta_1}{1+\gamma}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}$. Using equation (\ref{eq:QLLowerLimit})
 \[\lim_{\alpha_2 \to 1}\underline{\mathcal{B}}(\alpha_2)=\max_{s}g(s)-\theta_1\left(\frac{\theta_1}{1+\gamma}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}+ \left(\frac{\theta_1}{1+\gamma}\right)^{\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}} \]
 Under assumption 3,
 \[\lim_{\alpha_2\to1}\underline{\mathcal{B}}(\alpha_2)=\max_{s}g(s)-\theta_1^{\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}} \left(\frac{1}{1+\gamma}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}\left(\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}\right)<0\]
\end{proof}


Next we discuss what happens when the assets are outside the interval that
supports the interior solution. WLOG, consider the case $\tilde{b}_2>\bar{%
\mathcal{B}}_2(\alpha_2)$ where the non-negativity constraint is binding on
Agent 1's consumption in at least one state and $\lambda^{c_1}(s)>0$. We
will use the following three lemmas

\begin{lemma}
$\lim_t\lambda^{c_1}(s^t)=0$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First note that, the Envelope condition is still valid and the multiplier on
the implementability constraint, $\mu(s^t)$ is a martingale. The FOC imply
that $\lambda^{c_1}(s^t)$ and $\mu(s^t)$ are related by

\begin{equation*}
\mu(s^t)=\alpha_2-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\lambda^{c_1}(s^t)}{2}
\end{equation*}

Thus $\lambda^{c_1}(s^t)$ is also a martingale. Further the complementary
slackness conditions provide a lower bound of zero i.e $\lambda^{c_1}(s^t)\geq 0$. We can now apply the
standard martingale convergence theorems to argue that $\lambda^{c_1}(s^t)%
\to \lambda^*$. We now argue that this limit is always 0. Suppose this is
not the case and $\lambda^*>0$

Since the FOC of $l_1$ only depends on $\lambda^{c_1}$ (and other constants), $%
l_1\to l_1^{*}$. Since $\lambda^*>0$, Agent 1's consumption $c_1(s^t)\to 0$
and the resource constraint solves for Agent'2 consumption to be

\begin{equation*}
c_2(s^t)\to \theta_1l_1^*-g(s^t)
\end{equation*}

\footnote{%
Under the regularity assumption that $-\max_{s}g(s)+\theta_1
l_1^*\left(\alpha_2\right)>0$, we can verify the guess that the
non-negativity constraint on $c_2$ is slack}.

The implementability constraint now can be written as

\begin{equation*}
\theta_1l_{1}(s^t) + \tilde{b}_{2}(s^t) + l(s^t)h^{\prime }(l_{1}(s^t))-g(s^t)=%
\frac{\tilde{b_2(s^t)}}{\beta}
\end{equation*}

Iterating and taking limits we see that

\begin{equation*}
\lim_{j}\sum_{j}\beta^{j}\theta_1l_{1}(s^{t+j}) + \lim_{j}\beta^j \tilde{b}%
_{2}(s^{t+j}) + \lim_{j}\sum_{j}\beta^jl(s^t)h^{\prime
}(l_{1}(s^{t+j}))-\sum_{j}\beta^{j}g(s^{t+j})=\frac{\tilde{b_2(s^t)}}{\beta}
\end{equation*}

Note that all terms except $\lim_{j}\beta^j \tilde{b}_{2}(s^{t+j})$ and $%
\sum_{j}\beta^{j}g(s^{t+j})$ approach a constant. Further since $g(s^t)$ is
stochastic, $\lim_{j}\beta^j \tilde{b}_{2}(s^{t+j})$ is different from zero
with strictly positive probability, implying that assets will violate any
finite bounds. Thus we have $\lambda^*=0$, or the constraint is eventually
slack.
\end{proof}

Now we show that the long run assets are constant at $\bar{\mathcal{B}}%
_2(\alpha_2)$. This will follow from the fact that $\tilde{b}_2^{\prime }(%
\tilde{b}_2,s)$ is continuous and weakly increasing in $\tilde{b}_2$.

\begin{lemma}
$\tilde{b}^{\prime }_2(\tilde{b}_2,s)$is continuous and weakly increasing in
$\tilde{b}_2$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First note that $\lambda^{c1}(\tilde{b}_2,s)$ is increasing in $\tilde{b}_2$
as a higher value of $\tilde{b}_2$ tightens the non-negativity constraint on
$c_1$. Since $\mu(s)=\alpha_2-\frac12-\frac{\lambda^{c1}(s)}{2}$, it is
decreasing in $\tilde{b}_2$. Weak concavity of $V$ \footnote{%
In the CES case concavity of $V$ can be shown by observing that objective
function and the implementability constraint is linear in $\tilde{l}%
=l_1^{\gamma}$. The resource constraint is a weak inequality with the RHS
concave in $\tilde{l}$. Thus the constraint set is convex. Further the value
function is bounded, we can apply analogues of theorem 4.6-4.8 in SLP to
prove that $V$ is concave} and the envelope theorem imply that $\tilde{b}%
_2^{\prime }(\tilde{b}_2,s)$ is weakly increasing. Continuity comes from
applying the Maximum theorem to the problem
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
if $\tilde{b}_{2,-1}> \bar{\mathcal{B}}_2 (\alpha_2)$ then $\lim_{t}\tilde{b}%
_{2,t}=\bar{\mathcal{B}}_2 (\alpha_2)$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose not, then there exist a $t$ such that $\tilde{b}_{t}>\bar{\mathcal{B}%
}(\alpha_2)$ and $\tilde{b}_{2,t+1}<\bar{\mathcal{B}}(\alpha_2)$. This
implies that

\begin{equation*}
\tilde{b}_{2,t+1}=\tilde{b}_2^{\prime }[\tilde{b}_{2,t},s_t]< \tilde{b}%
_2^{\prime }[\bar{\mathcal{B}}_2(\alpha_2),s_t]
\end{equation*}
Since the previous lemma shows $\tilde{b}_2^{\prime }[\tilde{b}_2,s]$ is
increasing, we have a contradiction.
\end{proof}

With $\tilde{b}_2<\underline{\mathcal{B}}_2(\alpha_2)$, we have a symmetric
argument and long run assets settle down at the lower limit.

\vspace{3mm}Lastly we show that marginal disutility of labor is a
sub-martingale.

Thus we have,
\begin{equation}
l_{1,t}^{\gamma}=\frac{\theta_1(1+\lambda^{c_1}_t+\lambda^{c_2}_t)}{%
(1-\alpha_2)+ (\alpha_2-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\lambda_t^{c2}}{2}-\frac{%
\lambda^{c1}_t}{2})(1+\gamma)}
\end{equation}
Both $\lambda_t^{c1},\lambda_t^{c2}$ are martingales and it can be verified
that $l_{1,t}^{\gamma}$ is convex in either of the multiplier. Applying
Jensen's inequality, we have

\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{E}l_{1,t+1}^{\gamma }\geq l_{1,t}^{\gamma }
\end{equation*}

\smallskip

\subsection{Proof of Proposition \protect\ref{prop: long run forces}}

The Bellman equation for the optimal planners problem with log quadratic
preferences and IID shocks can be written as
\begin{equation*}
V(x,\rho) = \max_{c_1,c_2,l_1,x^{\prime },\rho^{\prime }} \sum_s \Pr(s)\left[%
\alpha_1\left(\log c_1(s) -\frac{l_1(s)^2}{2}\right)+\alpha_2\log
c_2(s)+\beta(s) V(x^{\prime }(s),\rho^{\prime }(s))\right]
\end{equation*}%
subject to the constraints
\begin{align}
1+\rho^{\prime }(s)[l_1(s)^2-1]+\beta(s)x^{\prime }(s) - \frac{x\frac{1}{%
c_2(s)}}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}]}=0  \label{eq.conStart} \\
\sum_s\frac{\Pr(s)}{c_1(s)}(\rho^{\prime }(s)-\rho) = 0 \\
\theta_1(s)l_1(s) -c_1(s)-c_2(s)-g = 0 \\
\rho^{\prime }(s) c_2(s)-c_1(s) = 0  \label{eq.conEnd}
\end{align}
Where the $\Pr(s)$ is the probability distribution of the aggregate state $s$. If
we let $\Pr(s)\mu(s)$, $\lambda$, $\Pr(s)\xi(s)$ and $\Pr(s)\phi(s)$ be the
Lagrange multipliers for the constraints (\ref{eq.conStart})-(\ref{eq.conEnd}%
) respectively then we obtain the following FONC for the planners problem

\begin{enumerate}
\item[$c_1(s):$]
\begin{equation}
\frac{\alpha_1\Pr(s)}{c_1(s)}-\frac{\lambda \Pr(s)}{c_1(s)^2}(\rho^{\prime
}(s)-\rho)-\Pr(s)\xi(s)-\Pr(s)\phi(s) = 0  \label{eq.c1FOC}
\end{equation}

\item[$c_2(s):$]
\begin{equation}
\frac{\alpha_2 \Pr(s)}{c_2(s)} + \frac{x\Pr(s)}{c_2(s)^2\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}]}%
\left[\mu(s)-\frac{\mathbb{E}[\mu\frac1{c_2}]}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}]}%
\right]-\Pr(s)\xi(s)+\Pr(s)\rho^{\prime }(s)\phi(s)=0  \label{eq.c2FOC}
\end{equation}

\item[$l_1(s):$]
\begin{equation}
-\alpha_1\Pr(s)l_1(s)+2\mu(s)\Pr(s)\rho^{\prime
}(s)l_1(s)+\theta_1(s)\Pr(s)\xi(s)=0
\end{equation}

\item[$x^{\prime }(s):$]
\begin{equation}
\beta(s) \Pr(s)V_x(x^{\prime }(s),\rho^{\prime }(s)) + \beta(s)\Pr(s)\mu(s) = 0
\label{eq.x'FOC}
\end{equation}

\item[$\rho^{\prime }(s):$]
\begin{equation}
\beta(s) \Pr(s) V_\rho(x^{\prime }(s),\rho^{\prime }(s))+\frac{\lambda \Pr(s)}{%
c_1(s)}+\mu(s)\Pr(s)[l_1(s)^2-1]+\Pr(s)\phi(s)c_2(s) = 0  \label{eq.FOCNend}
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

In addition there are two envelope conditions given by
\begin{align}
V_x(x,\rho) = -\sum_{s^{\prime }}\frac{\mu(s^{\prime })\Pr(s^{\prime
})\frac1{c_2(s^{\prime })}}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}]} = -\frac{\mathbb{E}%
[\mu\frac1{c_2}]}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}]} \\
V_\rho(x,\rho) = -\lambda\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_1}]  \label{eq.rho_env}
\end{align}

A steady state is then a collection of allocations, initial conditions and Lagrange multipliers $%
\{c_1(s),c_2(s),l_1(s),x,\rho,\mu(s),\lambda,\xi(s),\phi(s)\}$ such that
equations (\ref{eq.conStart})-(\ref{eq.rho_env}) are satisfied when $%
\rho^{\prime }(s) = \rho$ and $x^{\prime }(s) = x$. It should be clear that
is that if we replace $\mu(s) = \mu$ then, equation (\ref{eq.x'FOC}) is
always satisfied. Additionally under this assumption equation (\ref{eq.c2FOC}%
) simplifies significantly.
\begin{align*}
\frac{x\Pr(s)}{c_2(s)^2\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}]}\left[\mu(s)-\frac{\mathbb{E}%
[\mu\frac1{c_2}]}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}]}\right] = 0
\end{align*}
The first order conditions for a
steady can then be written simply as
\begin{align}
1+\rho[l_1(s)^2-1]+\beta(s)x-\frac{x}{ c_2(s)\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}]} = 0
\label{eq.imp} \\
\theta_1(s) l_1(s) - c_1(s)-c_2(s)-g=0  \label{eq.res} \\
\ \rho c_2(s)-c_1(s) = 0  \label{eq.rhoFOC} \\
\frac{\alpha_1}{c_1(s)}-\xi(s)-\phi(s) = 0  \label{eq.c1} \\
\frac{\alpha_2}{c_2(s)}-\xi(s)+\rho\phi(s) = 0  \label{eq.c2} \\
[2\mu \rho-\alpha_1]l_1(s)+\theta_1(s)\xi(s) = 0  \label{eq.l1} \\
\lambda\left[\frac1{c_1(s)}-\beta(s)\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_1}]\right]+\mu[%
l_1(s)^2-1]+\phi(s)c_2(s) = 0  \label{eq.R}
\end{align}
We can rewrite equation (\ref{eq.c1}) as
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\alpha_1}{c_2(s)} - \rho\xi(s) -\rho\phi(s) = 0
\end{equation*}%
by substituting $c_1(s) = \rho c_2(s)$. Adding this to equation (\ref{eq.c2}%
) and normalizing $\alpha_1+\alpha_2 = 1$ we obtain
\begin{equation}
\xi(s) = \frac1{\left(1+\rho\right)c_2(s)}\label{eq.xi}
\end{equation}%
which we can use to solve for $\phi(s)$ as
\begin{equation}
\phi(s) = \frac{\alpha_1-\rho\alpha_2}{\left(\rho(1+\rho)\right)c_2(s)}
\label{eq.phi}
\end{equation}
From equation (\ref{eq.imp}) we can solve for $l_1(s)^2 -1$ as
\begin{equation*}
l_1(s)^2-1 = \frac{x}{\rho\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}]}\left(\frac
1{c_2(s})-\beta(s)\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}]\right)-\frac1\rho
\end{equation*}%
This can be used along with equations (\ref{eq.R}) and (\ref{eq.phi}) to
obtain
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac\lambda \rho+\frac{\mu x}{\rho\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}]}%
\right)\left(\frac1{c_2(s)}-\beta(s)\mathbb{E}\left[\frac1{c_2}\right]%
\right) = \frac{\mu}{\rho}+\frac{\rho\alpha_2-\alpha_1}{\rho(1+\rho)}
\end{equation*}
Clearly as the LHS depends on $s$ while the RHS does not, Hence the solution to
this equation is
\begin{equation}
\lambda = - \frac{\mu x}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}]}
\end{equation}%
and
\begin{equation}
\mu = \frac{\alpha_1-\rho\alpha_2}{1+\rho}  \label{eq.mu}
\end{equation}
Combining these with equation (\ref{eq.l1}) we quickly obtain that
\begin{equation*}
\left[2\rho\frac{\alpha_1-\rho\alpha_2}{1+\rho}-\alpha_1\right]%
l_1(s)+\frac{\theta_1(s)}{\left(1+\rho\right)c_2(s)} = 0
\end{equation*}%
Then solving for $l_1(s)$ gives
\begin{equation*}
l_1(s) = \frac{\theta_1(s)}{\left(\alpha_1(1-\rho)+2\rho^2\alpha_2\right)c_2(s)}
\end{equation*}

\begin{remark}
Note that the labor tax rate is given by $1-\frac{c_1(s)l_1(s)}{\theta(s)}$. The previous expression shows that labor taxes are constant at the steady state. This property holds generally for CES preferences separable in consumption and leisure
\end{remark}

This we can plug into the aggregate resource constraint (\ref{eq.res}) to
obtain
\begin{equation*}
l_1(s) = \left(\frac{1+\rho}{\alpha_1(1-\rho)+2\rho^2\alpha_2}\right)\frac{1}{l_1(s)} +
\frac{g}{\theta_1(s)}
\end{equation*}%
letting $C(\rho) = \frac{1+\rho}{\alpha_1(1-\rho)+2\rho^2\alpha_2}$ we can
then solve for $l_1(s)$ as
\begin{equation*}
l_1(s) = \frac{g\pm\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta_1(s)^2}}{2\theta_1(s)}
\end{equation*}
The marginal utility of agent 2 is then
\begin{equation*}
\frac1{c_2(s)} = \left(\frac{1+\rho}{C(\rho)}\right)\left(\frac{g\pm\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)%
\theta_1(s)^2}}{2\theta_1(s)^2}\right)
\end{equation*}%
Note that in order for either of these terms to be positive we need $%
C(\rho)\geq 0$ implying that there is only one economically meaningful root.
Thus
\begin{equation}
l_1(s) = \frac{g+\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta_1(s)^2}}{2\theta_1(s)}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\frac1{c_2(s)} = \left(\frac{1+\rho}{C(\rho)}\right)\left(\frac{g+\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)%
\theta_1(s)^2}}{2\theta_1(s)^2} \right) \label{eq.uc2}
\end{equation}
A steady state is then a value of $\rho$ such that
\begin{equation}
x(s) = \frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s)^2-1]}{\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s)}{\mathbb{E}%
[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta(s)}  \label{eq.xSS}
\end{equation}%
s independent of $s$.

The following lemma, which orders consumption and labor across states, will
be useful in proving the parts of proposition \ref{prop: long run forces}.  As a notational aside we
will often use $\theta_{1,l}$ and $\theta_{1,h}$ to refer to $%
\theta_{1}(s_l) $ and $\theta_{1}(s_h)$ respectively. Where $s_l$ refers to
the low TFP state and $s_h$ refers to the high TFP state.

\begin{lemma}
Suppose that $\theta_1(s_l) < \theta_2(s_h)$ and $\rho$ such that $C(\rho) >
0$ then
\begin{equation*}
l_{1,l} = \frac{g+\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta_{1,l}^2}}{2\theta_{1,l}} > \frac{%
g+\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta_{1,h}^2}}{2\theta_{1,h}} = l_{1,h}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
\frac1{c_{2,l}} = \frac{1+\rho}{C(\rho)}\frac{g+\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)%
\theta_{1,l}^2}}{2\theta_{1,l}^2} > \frac{1+\rho}{C(\rho)}\frac{g+\sqrt{%
g^2+4C(\rho)\theta_{1,h}^2}}{2\theta_{1,h}^2} = \frac1{c_{2.h}}
\end{equation*}%
\label{lem.1}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The results should follow directly from showing that
the function
\begin{equation*}
l_1(\theta) = \frac{g+\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta}}{2\theta}
\end{equation*}%
is decreasing in $\theta$. Taking the derivative with respect to $\theta$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d l_1}{d\theta}(\theta) &=- \frac g{2\theta^2}-\frac{\sqrt{%
g+4C(\rho)\theta^2}}{2\theta^2} +\frac{4C(\rho)\theta}{2\theta\sqrt{%
g^2+4C(\rho)\theta^2}} \\
&=-\frac g{2\theta^2}-\frac{g+4C(\rho)\theta^2-4C(\rho)\theta^2}{2\theta^2%
\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta^2}} \\
&=-\frac g{2\theta^2}-\frac{g}{2\theta^2\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta^2}}<0
\end{align*}
That $\frac1{c_{2,l}}>\frac1{c_{2,h}}$ follows directly.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop: long run forces}]

\begin{description}
\item[Part 1.] In order for there to exist a $\rho$ such that equation (\ref%
{eq.xSS}) is independent of the state (and hence have a steady state) we
need the existence of root for the following function
\begin{equation*}
f (\rho) = \frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]}{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1]}-\frac{%
\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta }{\frac{%
1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta}
\end{equation*}
From lemma \ref{lem.1} we can conclude that
\begin{equation}
1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1] > 1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]  \label{eq.inc_order}
\end{equation}%
and
\begin{equation}
\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta >\frac{%
1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta  \label{eq.int_order}
\end{equation}%
for all $\rho > 0$ such that $C(\rho)\geq 0$. To begin with we will define $%
\underline \rho$ such that $C(\rho) > 0$ for all $\rho > \underline\rho$.
Note that we will have to deal with two different cases.

\begin{description}
\item[$\protect\alpha_1(1-\protect\rho)+2\protect\rho^2\protect\alpha_2 > 0$
for all $\protect\rho\geq 0$:] In this case we know that $C(\rho)\geq 0$ for
all $\rho$ and is bounded above and thus we will let $\underline \rho =0$.

\item[$\protect\alpha_1(1-\protect\rho)+2\protect\rho^2\protect\alpha_2 = 0$
for some $\protect\rho>0$:] In this case let $\underline \rho$ be the
largest positive root of $\alpha_1(1-\rho)+2\rho^2\alpha_2$. Note that $%
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \underline \rho^+}C(\rho) = \infty$
\end{description}

With this we note that\footnote{In the first case $\underline {\rho}=0$ and in the second case $l_1(\rho,s_l)=l_1(\rho,s_h)$ as $\rho \to \underline{\rho}^{+}$}
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \underline \rho^+} \frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]}{1+%
\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1]} = 1
\end{equation*}%
We can also show that
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\underline \rho^+} \frac{\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{\mathbb{%
E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta }{\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\mathbb{E}%
[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta} < 1
\end{equation*}
which implies that $\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \underline \rho^+} f(\underline
\rho) > 0$.

Taking the limit as $\rho\rightarrow\infty$ we see that $C(\rho)\rightarrow
0 $, given that $\frac g{\theta(s)} <1$, we can then conclude that
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\infty } 1+ \rho[l_1(\rho,s)^2-1] = -\infty
\end{equation*}
Thus, there exists $\overline \rho$ such that $1+\overline \rho[%
l_1(\overline \rho,s_l)^2-1] = 0$. \footnote{This can be seen from the fact $\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \underline
\rho^+} 1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2 -1] > 0$ and $\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \infty } 1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2 -1] > -\infty$, thus $\overline{\rho}$ exists in $(\underline{\rho},\infty)$ }(to be rigorous we actually want to
take the minimum over all roots). From equation (\ref{eq.inc_order}), we
know that
\begin{equation*}
0 = 1+\overline \rho[l_1(\overline \rho,s_l)^2-1] > 1+\overline \rho[%
l_1(\overline \rho,s_h)^2-1]
\end{equation*}
which implies in the limit
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \overline \rho^-}\frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]}{1+%
\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1]} = -\infty
\end{equation*}
which along with
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta }{\frac{%
1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta} \geq -1
\end{equation*}
allows us to conclude that $\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \overline \rho^-} f(\rho)
= -\infty$. The intermediate value theorem then implies that there exists $%
\rho_{SS}$ such that $f(\rho_{SS}) = 0$ and hence that $\rho_{SS}$ is a
steady state.

Finally, as $\rho_{SS} < \overline \rho$ we know that
\begin{equation*}
1+\rho_{SS}[l_1(\rho_{SS},s_l)-1] >0
\end{equation*}%
as $\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)} >1$ we can
conclude
\begin{equation*}
x_{SS} = \frac{1+\rho_{SS}[l_1(\rho_{SS},s_l)-1]}{\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{%
\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta} >0
\end{equation*}%
implying that the government will hold assets in the steady state (under the
normalization that agent 2 holds no assets).

\item[Part 2.] The condition that $R(s_h) = R(s_l)$ implies that
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\beta(s_l)\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)} = \frac{%
1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{\beta(s_h)\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}
\end{equation*}%
which simplifies to
\begin{equation}
\frac{\beta(s_h)}{\beta(s_l)} = \frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}
\end{equation}
In order for a steady state to exist with constant interest rates there must
be a root of the following function
\begin{align*}
f(\rho) &= \frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]}{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1]}-\frac{%
\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta(s_h) }{\frac{%
1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta(s_l)} \\
&= \frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]}{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1]}-\frac{\frac{%
1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{\beta(s_h)\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-1 }{\frac{%
1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\beta(s_l)\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-1}\frac{\beta(s_h)%
}{\beta(s_l)} \\
& = \frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]}{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1]}-\frac{%
1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}
\end{align*}
Taking limits of $f(\rho)$ as $\rho$ approaches $\underline\rho$ from the
positive side we already demonstrated
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\underline\rho^+}\frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]}{1+\rho%
[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1]} = 1
\end{equation*}
From equation (\ref{eq.uc2}) and Lemma \ref{lem.1} it is straightforward to
see that
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\underline\rho^+}\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}
< 1
\end{equation*}
which allows us to conclude that
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\underline\rho^+} f(\rho) > 0
\end{equation*}
Taking limits as $\rho$ approaches $\overline\rho$ from the negative
direction we know that
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\overline\rho^-}\frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]}{1+\rho[%
l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1]} = -\infty
\end{equation*}
As $\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{1/c_2(\rho,s_h)} > 0$ for all $\rho$ it is
straightforward to conclude that
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\overline\rho^-} f(\rho) = -\infty
\end{equation*}
Continuity then implies the existence of a $\rho^{SS}$ such that $%
f(\rho^{SS}) = 0$, and thus there exists a $\beta(s_l)$ and $\beta(s_h)$
such that $R(s_l) = R(s_h)$ in steady state. From Lemma \ref{lem.1}
\begin{equation*}
l(\rho,s_l) > l(\rho,s_h).
\end{equation*}
In order for
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1+\rho^{SS}[l_1(\rho^{SS},s_h)^2-1]}{1+\rho^{SS}[l_1(%
\rho^{SS},s_l)^2-1]} = \frac{1/c_2(\rho^{SS},s_h)}{1/c_2(\rho^{SS},s_l)} < 1
\end{equation*}
it is necessary that
\begin{equation*}
1+\rho^{SS}[l_1(\rho^{SS},s_l)^2-1] > 1+\rho^{SS}[l_1(\rho^{SS},s_h)^2-1] > 0
\end{equation*}
implying that the steady state asset level
\begin{equation*}
x_{SS} = \frac{1+\rho_{SS}[l_1(\rho_{SS},s_l)-1]}{\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{%
\mathbb{E}[\frac1{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta(s_l)} >0
\end{equation*}

\item[Part 3] As noted before, since $g/\theta (s)<1$ for all $s$ we have
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho \rightarrow \infty }1+\rho \lbrack l_{1}(\rho ,s)^{2}-1]=-\infty
\end{equation*}%
Thus, there exists $\rho_{SS}$ such that
\begin{equation*}
0>1+\rho_{SS}[l_{1}(\rho_{SS},s_{l})^{2}-1]>1\rho_{SS}[l_{1}(\rho_{SS},s_{h})^{2}-1]
\end{equation*}%
It is then possible to choose $\beta (s)<\frac{1/c_{2}(\rho_{SS},s)}{%
\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{c_{2}}](\rho_{SS})}$ such that
\begin{equation}
1>\frac{1+\rho_{SS}[l_{1}(\rho_{SS},s_{l})^{2}-1]}{1+\rho_{SS}[l_{1}(\rho_{SS},s_{h})^{2}-1]}=\frac{\frac{1/c_{2}(\rho_{SS},s_{l})%
}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{c_{2}}](\rho_{SS})}-\beta (s_{l})}{\frac{%
1/c_{2}(\rho_{SS},s_{h})}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{c_{2}}](\rho_{SS})}%
-\beta (s_{h})}  \label{eq.beta_cond}
\end{equation}%
Implying that for discount factor shocks $\beta (s)$, $\rho_{SS}$ is a
steady state level for the ratio of marginal utilities, with steady state
marginal utility weighted government debt
\begin{equation*}
x_{SS}=\frac{1+\rho_{SS}[l_{1}(\rho_{SS},s_{l})^{2}-1]}{\frac{%
1/c_{2}(\rho_{SS},s_{l})}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{c_{2}}](\rho_{SS})}%
-\beta (s_{l})}<0
\end{equation*}%
Thus, in the steady state, the government is holding debt, under the
normalization that the unproductive worker holds no assets. As $\frac{%
1/c_{2}(\rho ,s_{l})}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{c_{2}}](\rho )}>\frac{1/c_{2}(\rho
,s_{h})}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{c_{2}}](\rho )}$, in order for equation (\ref{eq.beta_cond}) to hold we need $\beta _{l}>\beta _{h}$. We can then rewrite
equation (\ref{eq.beta_cond}) as
\begin{equation*}
1>\frac{\beta (s_{h})}{\beta (s_{l})}>\frac{\frac{1/c_{2}(\rho_{SS},s_{l})}{\beta
_{l}\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{c_{2}}](\rho_{SS} )}-1}{\frac{1/c_{2}(\rho_{SS} ,s_{h})}{\beta
(s_{h})\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{c_{2}}](\rho_{SS} )}-1}
\end{equation*}%
Thus
\begin{equation}
R(s_{l})\frac{1/c_{2}(\rho_{SS} ,s_{l})}{\beta (s_{l})\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{c_{2}}%
](\rho_{SS} )}<\frac{1/c_{2}(\rho_{SS} ,s_{h})}{\beta (s_{h})\mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{c_{2}}%
](\rho_{SS} )}=R(s_{h})
\end{equation}%
in the steady state interest rates are positively correlated with TFP.
\end{description}

\subsection{Constrained optimum with unobservable assets\label{apndx: unobs-assets}}

We contrast allocations in the economy described in the previous section
with allocations in an economy in which the government does not observe
agents' assets. To define optimal allocations, we need to take a stand on
what assets agents can trade. In line with our previous analysis, we assume
that they can trade only a one-period risk-free bond. Later we will explain
how our conclusions would change with more general asset structures.

\smallskip We borrow a general formulation of the constrained optimal
problem from Golosov and Tsyvinski (2007). The mechanism designer collects
agents' reports about their types and chooses allocations of labor services
and consumption. The agents can re-trade consumption as they choose. Asset
prices are determined by market clearing conditions. Let $\left \{
e_{i,t},y_{i,t}\right \} _{i,t}$ be the allocation of consumption and labor
services that the planner assigns to agents. The utility of agent $i$ who
chooses basket $\left \{ e_{j,t},y_{j,t}\right \} _{t}$ and faces interest
rates $\left \{ R_{t}\right \} _{t}$ is
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{V}_{i}\left( \left \{ e_{j,t},y_{j,t},R_{t}\right \} _{t}\right)
=\max_{\left \{ c_{i,t}^{j},b_{i,t}^{j}\right \} _{t}}\mathbb{E}%
_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\beta ^{t}U_{i}\left( c_{i,t}^{j},\frac{y_{j,t}}{%
\theta _{i}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
subject to
\begin{equation*}
c_{i,t}^{j}+b_{i,t}^{j}=e_{j,t}+R_{t-1}b_{i,t-1}^{j}.
\end{equation*}
The mechanism designer chooses an allocation such that no agent wants to
re-trade along the equilibrium path. The optimal allocation solves\footnote{%
For details see \cite{Golosov01052007}.}
\begin{equation*}
\max_{\left \{ c_{i,t},y_{i,t},R_{t}\right \} _{i,t}}\mathbb{E}%
_{0}\sum_{i=1}^{I}\alpha _{i}\pi _{i}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\beta
^{t}U^{i}\left( c_{i,t},\frac{y_{i,t}}{\theta _{i}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
subject to (\ref{feasibility goods}), (\ref{FOC Euler}) and%
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\beta ^{t}U^{i}\left( c_{i,t},\frac{y_{i,t}%
}{\theta _{i}}\right) \geq \mathcal{V}_{i}\left( \left \{
c_{j,t},y_{j,t},R_{t}\right \} _{t}\right) \text{ for all }i,j.
\end{equation*}

An optimal allocation can be decentralized by a non-linear tax $\left \{
T_{t}\left( y_{t},...,y_{0}\right) \right \} _{t}.$ We can define a
competitive equilibrium in a fashion that parallels Definition \ref{Def:
optimal CE affine}. To maintain consistency with the informational
requirement of the mechanism design problem, we assume that the government
does not know who holds government debt (if government debt were to be
issued in an equilibrium).  As discussed in Section \ref{sec:Ricardian101},  Theorem \ref{theorem: main} continues to hold in this economy. Thus, again
the distribution of net assets $\left \{ \tilde{b}_{i,t}\right \} $ is
uniquely determined, but not agents' gross assets. These results show that
dynamic properties of optimal taxes and allocations depend crucially on
whether the government can observe and tax individuals' asset holdings.

Below we construct an example that shows that optimal allocations
are generally history dependent, in contrast to the history independent
optimal allocations that emerge for an economy where the government can
observe all agents' asset holdings.

We consider a version of the  economy where $I=2$  with Agent 1 having quasilinear preferences and Agent 2's utility is given by $%
u(c)-h_{2}\left( \frac{y}{\theta _{2}}\right) .$ \ We assume that the
planner assigns a sufficiently high Pareto weight on Agent 1 so that it is
agent 2 incentive constraint which binds.

%Similarly to the discussion of Section \ref{Sec: quasi-linear with risk
%aversion}, two cases are possible.
The equilibrium can either be interior,
in which case $c_{1,t}$ is always above $\underline{c},$ or the non-negativity constraint eventually binds. The latter case automatically implies
history-dependence of allocations, so we consider the former case. The
optimal tax problem is

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation*}
\max_{\left \{ c_{i,t}^{j},b_{i,t}^{j},y_{i,t},R_{t}\right \} _{t,i,j}}%
\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\beta ^{t}\left[ \alpha _{1}\left(
c_{1,t}-h_{1}\left( \frac{y_{1,t}}{\theta _{1}}\right) \right) +\alpha

y_{1,t}}{\theta _{2}}\right) \right)
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
c_{2,t}+b_{2,t}=e_{2,t}+\frac{1}{\beta }b_{2,t-1}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}

c_{2,t+1}\right)

\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}

c_{2,t+1}^{1}\right)
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
c_{1,t}+b_{1,t}=e_{1,t}+\frac{1}{\beta }b_{1,t-1}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
c_{1,t}+c_{2,t}+g_{t}=y_{1,t}+y_{2,t}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
b_{i,t}^{j}\geq \underline{B}.
\end{equation*}

\smallskip There are a few redundant equations here. Without loss of
generality we can set $b_{1,t}=0$ for all $t$ in which case $%
c_{1,t}=e_{1,t}. $ Moreover, it is clear that the Lagrange multiplier on the
second constraint must be zero. Therefore, we have

\begin{equation*}
\max_{\left \{ c_{i,t}^{j},b_{i,t}^{j},y_{i,t}\right \} _{t,i,j}}\mathbb{E}%
_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\beta ^{t}\left[ \alpha _{1}\left(
c_{1,t}-h_{1}\left( \frac{y_{1,t}}{\theta _{1}}\right) \right) +\alpha

\right]

s.t.%
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\beta ^{t}\left( u(c_{2,t})-h_{2}\left(
\frac{y_{2,t}}{\theta _{2}}\right) \right) \geq \mathbb{E}%

y_{1,t}}{\theta _{2}}\right) \right)

\begin{equation*}
c_{2,t}^{1}+b_{2,t}^{1}=c_{1,t}+\frac{1}{\beta }b_{2,t-1}^{1}

\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
c_{1,t}+c_{2,t}+g_{t}=y_{1,t}+y_{2,t}
\end{equation*}
Guess that neither Euler equation constraint binds. Take the first-order
conditions%
\begin{equation}
\alpha _{1}-\eta _{2,t}^{1}=\lambda _{t}  \label{ap: c_1t}
\end{equation}%
\begin{equation}
u^{\prime }\left( c_{2,t}\right) \left( \alpha _{2}+\mu \right) =\lambda _{t}
\label{ap: c_2t}
\end{equation}%
\begin{equation}
\mu u^{\prime }\left( c_{2,t}^{1}\right) =\eta _{2,t}^{1}  \label{ap: c1_2t}
\end{equation}%
\begin{equation}
\eta _{2,t}^{1}=\mathbb{E}_{t}\eta _{2,t+1}^{1}  \label{ap: b1_2t}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
From (\ref{ap: b1_2t}) $\eta _{2,t}^{1}$ is a martingale, therefore from (%
\ref{ap: c_1t}) $, \lambda _{t}$ is a martingale, and therefore $u^{\prime
}\left( c_{2,t}\right) $ and $u^{\prime }\left( c_{2,t}^{1}\right) $ are
martingales, which confirms our guess. Moreover, $u^{\prime }\left(
c_{2,t}\right) ,$ $u^{\prime }\left( c_{2,t}^{1}\right) ,$ $\lambda _{t}$
and $\eta _{2,t}^{1}$ all must converge. Next we discuss what they must
converge to.

Note that since $\lambda _{t}$ converges to a constant, the first-order
conditions for $y_{2,t}$ and $y_{1,t}$ imply that they also converge to
constants. Since $c_{2,t}$ converges to a constant, $c_{1,t}$ must fluctuate
to offset fluctuations in $g_{t}.$ If $c_{1,t}$ fluctuates, then $u^{\prime
}\left( c_{2,t}^{1}\right) \rightarrow 0$ and therefore $\eta
_{2,t}^{1}\rightarrow 0.$ This implies that in the long run this economy
converges to the constrained optimal allocations discussed in Section \ref{Sec: extensions-NDPF}. Intuitively, what happens is that as $c_{1,t}$ fluctuates, the
agent 2, if he deviates, accumulates infinitely large amount of assets. When
he does that, smoothing fluctuations in $c_{1,t}$ has no effect on his
welfare, and we get back to the fully constrained optimum allocations.

\smallskip Note that $c_{2,t}$ cannot be constant in all $t.$ If it were,
then $c_{2,t}^{1}$ would also have to be constant in all $t,$ which is
impossible since $c_{1,t}$ must fluctuate.

\subsection{Numerical Methods}\label{apndx: numerical methods}
This section will outline our numerical methods used to solve for and linearize around a complete markets steady state in the case of a 2 state iid process for the aggregate state.  We will specialize to the two agent case and for the remainder of this section it will be assumed that the Bellman equation is written in the form
\begin{equation}
	V(x,\rho) = \max_{c_i(s),l_i(s),x'(s),\rho'(s)} \sum_s P(s)\left(\left[\sum_i\pi_i \alpha_i U(c_i(s),l_i(s))\right] + \beta(s) V(x'(s),\rho'(s))\right)\label{eq.obj}
\end{equation}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	&U_{c,2}(s)c_2(s)+U_{l,2}(s)l_2(s) - \rho'(s)\left[U_{c,1}(s)c_1(s)+U_{l,1}(s)l_1(s)\right]+ \beta(s)x'(s) = \frac{x U_{c,2}(s)}{\mathbb{E} U_{c,2}}\label{eq.imp_con}\\
	&\sum_s P(s) U_{c,1}(s)(\rho(s) -\rho) = 0\\
	&\frac{\rho'(s)}{\theta_1(s)}U_{l,1}(s) = \frac{1}{\theta_2(s)}U_{l,2}(s)\\
	& \pi_1 c_1(s)  +\pi_2 c_2(s) + g(s) = \pi_1\theta_1(s)l_1(s)+\pi_2\theta_2(s)l_2(s)\\
	& U_{c,2}(s) = \rho'(s) U_{c,1}(s)\label{eq.rho_con}
\end{align}\end{subequations}  Note that some of the constraints have been modified a little for ease of differentiation.  Associated with these constraints we have the Lagrange multipliers $P(s)\mu(s)$, $\lambda$,$P(s)\phi(s)$,$P(s)\xi(s)$, and $P(s)\zeta(s)$.
\subsubsection{Steady State}  By taking first order conditions it is possible to numerically determine the location of a stationary steady state.  The first order conditions with respect to the choice variables are as follows (note we will be using the notation $\mathbb E z$ to represent $\sum_s P(s) z(s)$ for some variable $z$)
\begin{subequations}
\begin{description}
	\item[$c_1(s)$:]
	\begin{equation}
		\pi_1\alpha_1U_{c,1}(s)+\mu(s)\rho'(s)\left[U_{cc,1}(s)c_1(s)+U_{c,1}(s)\right]+\lambda U_{cc,1}(s)(\rho'(s)-\rho)-\pi_1\xi(s)+\zeta(s)\rho'(s)U_{cc,1}(s) = 0\label{eq.foc_c1}
	\end{equation}
	\item[$c_2(s)$:]
	\begin{equation}
		\pi_2\alpha_2 U_{c,2}(s)-\mu(s)\left[U_{cc,2}(s)c_2(s)+ U_{c,2}(s)\right] +\frac{xU_{cc,2}(s)}{\mathbb E U_{c,2}}\left(\mu(s) - \frac{\mathbb E \mu U_{c,2}}{\mathbb E U_{c,2}}\right) - \pi_2\xi(s) -\zeta(s) U_{cc,2}(s) = 0
	\end{equation}
	\item[$l_1(s)$:]
	\begin{equation}
		\pi_1\alpha_1 U_{l,1}(s)+\mu(s)\rho(s)\left[U_{ll,1}(s)l_1(s)+U_{l,1}(s)\right]-\frac{\rho'(s)}{\theta_1(s)}\phi(s)U_{ll,1}(s)+\pi_1\theta_1(s)\xi(s) = 0
	\end{equation}
	\item[$l_2(s)$:]
	\begin{equation}
		\pi_2 \alpha_2 U_{l,2}(s) -\mu(s)\left[ U_{ll,2}(s)l_2(s)+U_{l,2}(s)\right] + \frac{\phi(s)}{\theta_2(s)}U_{ll,2}(s) +\pi_2\theta_2(s)\xi(s) = 0
	\end{equation}
	\item[$x'(s)$:]
	\begin{equation}
		 V_x(x'(s),\rho'(s)) - \mu(s) = 0 \label{eq.foc_x}
	\end{equation}
	\item[$\rho'(s)$:]
	\begin{equation}
		\beta(s) V_\rho(x'(s),\rho'(s)) +\mu(s)\left[U_{c,1}(s)c_1(s)+U_{l,1}(s)l_1(s)\right] + \lambda U_{c,1}(s) - \phi(s) \frac{U_{l,1}(s)}{\theta_1(s)} + U_{c,1}(s)\zeta(s) = 0\label{eq.foc_rho}
	\end{equation}
\end{description} \end{subequations} Equations (\ref{eq.imp_con})-(\ref{eq.rho_con}) and (\ref{eq.foc_c1})-(\ref{eq.foc_rho}) then define the necessary conditions for an interior maximization of the planners problem for the state $(x,\rho)$.  In addition to these we have the two envelop conditions
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
	V_x(x,\rho)= \frac{\sum_sP(s) \mu(s) U_{c,2}(s)}{\mathbb E U_{c,2}(s)} = \frac{\mathbb E\mu U_{c,2}}{\mathbb E U_{c,2}}\label{eq.env_x}
\end{equation}and
\begin{equation}
	V_\rho(x,\rho) = -\lambda \mathbb E U_{c,1}\label{eq.env_rho}
\end{equation}\end{subequations}  A steady state will then be a set of allocations and Lagrange multipliers $\{c_1(s),c_2(s),l_1(s),l_2(s),x,\rho,\mu(s),\lambda,\phi(s),\xi(s),\zeta(s)\}$  that solve equations (\ref{eq.imp_con})-(\ref{eq.rho_con}), (\ref{eq.foc_c1})-(\ref{eq.foc_rho}), and (\ref{eq.env_x})-(\ref{eq.env_rho}).  It should be noted that taking $\mu(s) = \mu = V_x(x,\rho)$ will solve both equations (\ref{eq.foc_x}) and (\ref{eq.env_x}).  Thus a steady state will be a set of allocations and Lagrange multipliers $\{c_1(s),c_2(s),l_1(s),l_2(s),x,\rho,\mu,\lambda,\phi(s),\xi(s),\zeta(s)\}$ that solves the following system of equations
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	U_{c,2}(s)c_2(s)+U_{l,2}(s)l_2(s) - \rho\left[U_{c,1}(s)c_1(s)+U_{l,1}(s)l_1(s)\right]+\beta(s)x -\frac{x U_{c,2}(s)}{\mathbb E U_{c,2}}\label{eq.FSS_start}\\
	\frac{U_{l,2}(s)}{\theta_2(s)} - \frac{\rho U_{l,1}(s)}{\theta_1(s)}=0\\
	\pi_1 c_1(s)+\pi_2 c_2(s)+g(s) = \pi_1 \theta_1(s) l_1(s) + \pi_2\theta_2(s) l_2(s)=0\\
	\rho U_{c,1}(s)-U_{c,2}(s) =0
	\pi_1\alpha_1 U_{c,1}(s) + \mu\rho\left[ U_{cc,1}(s) c_1(s)+U_{c,1}(s)\right] -\pi_1\xi(s)  + \rho\eta(s)U_{cc,1}(s) = 0\\
	\pi_2\alpha_2 U_{cc,2}(s) - \mu\left[ U_{cc,2}(s)c_2(s)+U_{c,2}(s)\right] - \pi_2\xi(s) -\eta(s) U_{cc,2}(s) = 0\\
	\pi_1 \alpha_1 U_{l,1}(s) +\mu\rho\left[U_{ll,1}(s) l_1(s) + U_{l,1}(s)\right] - \frac\rho{\theta_1(s)}\phi(s) U_{ll,1}(s) + \pi_1\theta_1(s)\xi(s) = 0\\
	\pi_2\alpha_2 U_{l,2}(s)  -\mu\left[U_{ll,2}(s)l_2(s) + U_{l,2}(s)\right] +\frac{\phi(s)}{\theta_2(s)} U_{ll,2}(s) + \pi_2\theta_2(s)\xi(s) = 0\\
	\lambda\left[U_{c,1}(s)-\beta(s)\mathbb E U_{c,1}\right] + \mu\left[ U_{c,1}(s)c_1(s) + U_{l,1}(s) l_1(s)\right] - \phi(s)\frac{U_{l,1}(s)}{\theta_1(s)} + U_{c,1}(s)\xi(s) = 0\label{eq.FSS_end}
\end{align}\end{subequations}  Taking $z$ to be the stacked vector $\{c_1(s),c_2(s),l_1(s),l_2(s),x,\rho,\mu,\lambda,\phi(s),\xi(s),\zeta(s)\}$, the equations (\ref{eq.FSS_start})-(\ref{eq.FSS_end}) then define a vector function $F_{SS}(X)$ for which the steady state must satisfy $F_{SS}(X_{SS}) = 0$.  An observant reader will have noted that the system $F_{SS}(X) = 0$ is only square when then number of aggregates states is 2.   In the case of where there are 2 aggregate states we have verified numerically ( using a non-linear equation solver ) that a steady state does exist for nearly all of the parameter space.  When the number of states is greater than two, there generically does not exist a steady state, however we find numerically that there exists an $\tilde X$ such that $F_{SS}(\tilde X) \approx 0$.  Our solutions to Bellman equation find that the economy will converge in the long run to a region a round this point.
\subsubsection{Linearization}  In order to check local stability we developed a way of linearizing locally around the steady state.  Given the discussion above we will therefore be restricting ourselves to a 2 state iid process for the aggregate state.  The optimal policy function, which we will denote as $z(x,\rho)$, must satisfy $F(z,y,g(z)) = 0$ where $F$ represents the system of equations (\ref{eq.imp_con})-(\ref{eq.foc_rho}), $y$ is the state vector $(x,\rho)$, and $g$ is the mapping of next periods policies into the derivatives of the value function.  In other words
\[
	g(z) = \left(\bmat V_x(x'(1),\rho'(1))\\ V_\rho(x'(1),\rho'(1)\\ V_x(x'(2),\rho'(2))\\ V_\rho(x'(2),\rho'(2))\emat\right)
\]The optimal policy function is then a function $z(x,R)$ that satisfies the relationship $F(z(y),y,g(z(y))) = 0$.  Taking total derivatives around the steady stat $\ov y$ and $\ov z = z(\ov y)$
\[
	D_zF(\ov z,\ov y, g(\ov z))D_yz(\ov y)+D_yF(\ov z, \ov y, g(\ov z)) + D_v F(\ov z, \ov y, g(\ov z)) D g(\ov z) D_y z(\ov z) = 0
\]  In order to linearize $z(y)$ around the steady state $\ov y$ we need to compute $D_y z(\ov y)$.  The problem is that $g$ depends on the planners value function which is difficult to compute.  The envelope conditions (\ref{eq.env_x})-(\ref{eq.env_rho}) tell us that $V_x$ and $V_\rho$ depend on the policies, i.e.
\[
	\left(\bmat V_x(x,\rho)\\ V_\rho(x,\rho)\emat\right) = v( z(x,\rho) ) =  \left(\bmat -\sum_{s'}\frac{\mu(s') P(s')U_{c,2}(s)}{\mathbb E\left[U_{c,2}\right]}\\ -\lambda \mathbb E\left[U_{c,1}\right]\emat\right)
\]  If we let $\Phi_s$ be the matrix that maps $z(x,R)$ into $\left(\bmat x'(s)\\ R'(s)\emat\right)$ then we can write $g(x,R)$ as a function of $z$ and $v$ as follows
\[
	g(z) = \left(\bmat v(z(\Phi_1 z))\\ v(z(\Phi_2 z))\emat\right)
\]taking derivatives we quickly obtain that
\begin{align*}
	D_z g(\ov z) &= \left(\bmat D v(z(\Phi_1 \ov z)) & 0 \\ 0&  D v(z(\Phi_2 \ov z))\emat\right)\left(\bmat D_y z(\Phi_1 \ov z) & 0\\ 0& D_y z(\Phi_1\ov z)\emat\right) \underbrace{\left(\bmat \Phi_1\\ \Phi_2\emat\right)}_{\Phi}\\
	&=\left(\bmat Dv(\ov z) &0\\0& D v(\ov z)\emat\right)\left(\bmat D_y z(\ov y) &0\\0&D_y z(\ov y)\emat\right)\Phi
\end{align*}  We can then go back to our original matrix equation to obtain
\begin{align}
	D_y z(\ov y) =& -D_z F(\ov z,\ov y, g(\ov z))^{-1}D_yF(\ov z,\ov y,g(\ov z))\nonumber\\
	& - D_zF(\ov z,\ov y,g(\ov z))^{-1} D_v F(\ov z, \ov y, g(\ov z))\left(\bmat Dv(\ov z) &0\\0& D v(\ov z)\emat\right)\left(\bmat D_y z(\ov y) &0\\0&D_y z(\ov y)\emat\right)\Phi D_y z(\ov y) \label{eq.linearization}
\end{align}  This is now a non-linear matrix equation for $D_y z(\ov y)$,  where all the other terms can be computed using the steady state values $\ov z$ and $\ov y$ (note $g(\ov z)$ is known from the envelope conditions at the steady state).  Furthermore, $D_y z(\ov y)$ gives us the linearization of the policy rules since to first order
\[
	z \approx \ov z + D_y z(\ov y)(y-\ov y)
\]Our procedure for computing the linearization proceeds as follows
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find the steady state by solving the system of equations (\ref{eq.FSS_start} - \ref{eq.FSS_end}).  Numerically, we have found that this is very robust to the parameters of the model.
		\item  Compute $D_zF(\ov z,\ov y,g(\ov z))$, $D_zF(\ov z,\ov y,g(\ov z))$ and $D_vF(\ov z,\ov y,g(\ov z))$ by numerically differentiating $F$ (note, if greater precision is needed formulas for these derivative could in principle be derived by hand)
		\item  Compute $DV$ around the steady state values of $c_1$,$c_2$, $\mu$ and $\lambda$.
		\item  Solve the matrix equation (\ref{eq.linearization}).  This is done using the NAG non-linear equation solver.   The method is somewhat problematic as there exists a near zero that the non-linear solver often finds.  Thus the solution method involves guessing 100 random starting points and choosing the best solution.
	\end{enumerate}
Given the linearized policy rules it is then possible to evaluate the local stability of the steady state.  We find that in the absence of discount factor shocks the steady state is stable generically across the parameter space.
